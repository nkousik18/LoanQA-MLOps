This project focuses on digitizing unstructured documents (PDFs or scanned uploads) and
empowering users through translation, voice assistance, and an interactive chatbot. Users can
upload documents, have them digitized and structured, and interactively learn about any word
or sentence by clicking on it—triggering a right-side panel with explanations, translations, or
voice playback. The solution will be delivered as a web dashboard for maximum accessibility
and feature richness. A Chrome extension is considered for future scope.
We will use open-source OCR, translation, and language understanding datasets to train and
evaluate the system's ability to extract, translate, and explain document content. These
datasets are essential for robust digitization and user education features.

1. Introduction
2. Dataset Information
a) Dataset Introduction
b) Data Card
c) Data Sources
OCR:BhasaAnuvaad, IIIT-ILOCR
Translation:BhasaAnuvaad, CVSS
Language Understanding:SQuAD, IndicNLP
d) Data Rights and Privacy
All datasets are open-source and used for research/non-commercial purposes, with no PII
included.
User-uploaded documents will be processed securely, with encryption and access controls.


=== PAGE 2 ===
The system will comply with GDPR and similar regulations by anonymizing data, obtaining
user consent, and allowing data deletion on request.
3. Data Planning and Splits
Loading: Scripts to ingest PDFs/images, convert to text using OCR.
Preprocessing: Clean extracted text, segment sentences, detect language, and align with
translations.
Managing Data: Use version control (e.g., DVC), store metadata (language, domain,
source).
Splitting: 80% training, 10% validation, 10% test, stratified by language and document
type.
4. GitHub Repository
Link: (To be created, e.g., github.com/your-org/doc-digitizer)
Folder Structure:
/data/ — Data scripts and sample datasets
/ocr/ — OCR and preprocessing code
/translation/ — Translation and explanation modules
/voice/ — Voice synthesis and playback
/dashboard/ — Web dashboard code
/docs/ — Documentation and diagrams
/tests/ — Unit/integration tests
README.md — Overview, install, usage, contribution
5. Project Scope
a) Problems
Unstructured documents are hard to search, analyze, or understand.
Language barriers and complex terms hinder user comprehension.
Lack of interactive, accessible tools for document education.
b) Current Solutions
Basic OCR tools extract text but lack translation or explanation features.
Some web apps offer translation, but not interactive explanations or voice assistance.
No seamless browser-based solution for real-time document education.

Bottlenecks:
Improvements:
c) Proposed Solutions
Digitize and structure documents using OCR and NLP.
Provide instant translation, voice playback, and chatbot explanations for any selected text.
Deliver as a web dashboard for easy access and integration (Chrome extension in future
scope).
6. Current Approach Flowchart and Bottleneck
Detection
1. User uploads PDF/scanned document
2. OCR extracts text and structure
3. Text is segmented into sentences/words
4. User clicks a word/sentence → right panel pops up
5. Panel shows translation, explanation, and voice playback
6. Chatbot available for further questions
OCR errors with poor-quality scans
Translation/explanation accuracy for domain-specific terms
Real-time performance for large documents
UI responsiveness and accessibility
Use advanced OCR (e.g., Tesseract, BhasaAnuvaad)
Fine-tune translation/explanation models on domain data
Optimize UI for speed and accessibility
7. Metrics Objectives and Business Goals
Metrics: OCR accuracy, translation BLEU score, user engagement (clicks, time spent),
response latency, user satisfaction surveys
Objectives:
Achieve >90% OCR accuracy on test set
BLEU >25 for translations
<2s latency for panel pop-up
80%+ positive user feedback
Business Goals:
Reduce manual document review time


=== PAGE 4 ===
Increase user understanding and satisfaction
Enable compliance with multilingual and accessibility standards
8. Failure Analysis
Risks:
Poor OCR/translation for low-quality or handwritten documents
Privacy breaches if user data is mishandled
UI/UX issues causing user frustration
Mitigation:
Use robust models and regular retraining
Encrypt and access-control all user data
Iterative UI testing and feedback
9. Deployment Infrastructure
Infrastructure:
Cloud-based OCR/NLP/translation services (e.g., AWS, GCP)
Secure storage for user documents
Web dashboard (React/Vue)
RESTful APIs for backend processing
Supported Platforms:
All major browsers (dashboard)
Flowchart:
User → Dashboard → Backend API → OCR/NLP/Translation → Output Panel
10. Monitoring Plan
Monitor OCR/translation accuracy, API latency, error rates, and user interactions
Log and audit access to user documents for security
Collect user feedback for continuous improvement
11. Success and Acceptance Criteria
90% OCR accuracy and BLEU >25 on test data
<2s response time for panel pop-up
80%+ user satisfaction in surveys
No major security/privacy incidents

12. Timeline Planning (12 Weeks)
Buffer: 2-3 days per major task for risk mitigation and review.
Chrome extension: Planned for future scope after dashboard MVP.
13. Additional Information
UI/UX: The dashboard will feature a document viewer with clickable text. When a user clicks
a word or sentence, a right-side panel will display translation, explanation, and voice
playback. The chatbot will be accessible from the panel for further queries.
Accessibility: Voice assistance and screen reader compatibility will be prioritized.
Scalability: The backend will be designed to handle multiple concurrent users and large
documents efficiently.
Documentation: Comprehensive user and developer documentation will be maintained in
the repository.
Deliver a robust web dashboard for document digitization and user education in 12 weeks.
Prioritize core features (digitization, translation, voice, chatbot, interactive panel).
Plan Chrome extension as a future enhancement after MVP delivery.
