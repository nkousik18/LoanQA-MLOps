Errors + Grace Failure
Chapter worksheet
Instructions
Block out time to get as many cross-functional leadsas possible together in a room to work
through these exercises & checklists.
Exercises
1. Error audit [~1 hour]
Collect canonical error examples to define existingand potential errors and solutions.
2. Quality assurance [~30 minutes]
Prioritize how you'll test and monitor errors andreporting so you can hear from your
users early and often.

Errors + graceful failure
1. Error audit
As a team, brainstorm what kinds of errors users couldencounter. If your team has a working
prototype of your feature, try to add current examples.
Use the template below to start collecting error examplesso your team has a shared
understanding about the different error types andsolutions your model could produce.
Error
Add screenshots, pictures, or logs to show what theuser sees when
encountering the error

high
Error type
System limitation- Your system can't provide theright
answer, or any answer at all, due to inherent limitationsto the
system.
Context- The system is “working as intended,” butthe user
perceives an error because the actions of the systemaren't
well-explained, break the user's mental model, orwere based
on poor assumptions.
Background- Situations in which the system isn'tworking
correctly, but neither the user nor the system registeran error.
Error sources
Take each error identified above through these questionsto determine the source of the error:

Errors + graceful failure
Input error signals
Did the user anticipate the auto-correction of theirinput into an AI system?
Was the user’s habituation interrupted?
Did the model improperly weigh a user action or othersignal?If yes, likely a
context error.
Relevance error signals
Is the model lacking available data or requirementsfor prediction accuracy?
Is the model receiving unstable or noisy data?
Is the system output presented to users in a way thatisn't relevant to the user’s
needs?
System hierarchy error
Is your user connecting your product to another system,and it isn't clear which
system is in charge?
Are there multiple systems monitoring a single (orsimilar) output and an event
causes simultaneous alerts?Signal crashes increasethe user’s mental load
because they have to parse multiple signals to figureout what happened and
what to do next.
Failure state
Is your feature unusable as the result of multipleerrors?

Error resolution
Once you have identified the source or sources ofthe error, complete the sections below for
each of the errors in the template with your team’splan for improving / reducing the identified
error: Create as many copies as you need to coverall your identified errors.
Error rationale
Why the user thinks this is an error:
Solution type
Feedback
User control
Other:
Error resolution
User path:
Examples: User sees errors, gives feedback, completestask; User sees error, takes over
control, completes task
Opportunity for model improvement:
Example: User’s feedback logged for model tuning

2. Quality assurance
Getting your feature into users’ hands is essentialfor identifying errors that your team, as expert
users, may never encounter. Meet as a team to prioritizehow you want to monitor errors
reported by users so that your model is being testedand criticized by your users early and often.
As you have this discussion, consider all potentialsources of error reporting:
●
Reports sent to customer service
●
Comments and reports sent through social media channels
●
In-product metrics
●
In-product surveys
●
User research (out-of-product surveys, deep dive interviews,diary studies, etc.)
