User Needs + Defining Success
Chapter worksheet
Instructions
Block out time to get as many cross-functional leadsas possible together in a room to work
through these exercises & checklists.
Exercises
1. Evidence of user need [multiple sessions]
Gather existing research and make a case for usingAI to solve your user need.
2. Augmentation versus automation [multiple sessions]
Conduct user research to understand attitudes aroundautomation versus augmentation.
3. Design your reward function [~1 hour]
Weigh the trade offs between precision and recallfor the user experience.
4. Define success criteria [~1 hour]
Agree on how to measure if your feature is workingor not, and consider the second
order effects.

User needs + defining success
1. Evidence of user need
Before diving into whether or not to use AI, yourteam should gather user research detailing the
problem you're trying to solve. The person in chargeof user research should aggregate existing
evidence for the team to reference in the subsequentexercises.
User research summary
List out the existing evidence you have supportingyour user need. Add more rows as needed.
Date
Source
Summary of findings
Make a case for and against your AI feature
Meet as a team, look at the existing user researchand evidence you have, and  detail the user
need you're trying to solve.
Next, write down a clear, focused statement of theuser need and read through each of the
statements below to identify if your user need isa potential good fit for an AI solution.
At the end of this exercise your team should be alignedon whether AI is a solution worth
pursuing and why.

The core experience requires
recommending different content to
different users.
The core experience requires
prediction of future events.
Personalization will improve the user
experience.
User experience requires natural
language interactions.
Need to recognize a general class of
things that is too large to articulate
every case.
Need to detect low occurrence events
that are constantly evolving.
An agent or bot experience for a
particular domain.
The user experience doesn't rely on
predictability.
The most valuable part of the core
experience is its predictability
regardless of context or additional
user input.
The cost of errors is very high and
outweighs the benefits of a small
increase in success rate.
Users, customers, or developers need
to understand exactly everything that
happens in the code.
Speed of development and getting to
market first is more important than
anything else, including the value using
AI would provide.
People explicitly tell you they don’t
want a task automated or augmented.

2. Augmentation versus automation
Conduct research to understand user attitudes
If your team has a hypothesis for why AI is a goodfit for your user’s need, conduct user research
to further validate if AI is a good solution throughthe lens of automation or augmentation.
If your team is light on field research for the problemspace you’re working in, contextual
inquiries can be a great method to understand opportunitiesfor automation or augmentation.
Below are some example questions you can ask to learnabout how your users think about
automation and augmentation.
Research protocol questions
●
If you were helping to train a new coworker for asimilar role, what would be
the most important tasks you would teach them first?
●
Tell me more about that action you just took, is thatan action you repeat:
○
Hourly
○
Daily
○
Weekly
○
Monthly
○
Quarterly
○
Annually
●
If you had a human assistant to work with on thistask, what, if any, duties
would you give them to carry out?

User needs + defining success
If going to meet your users in context isn’t feasible, you can also look into prototyping a
selection of automation and augmentation solutionsto understand initial user reactions.
TheTriptech methodis an early concept evaluationmethod that can be used to outline user
requirements based on likes, dislikes, expectations,and concerns.
Research protocol questions
●
Describe your first impression of this feature.
●
How often do you encounter the following problem:[insert problem/need
statement here]?
○
Daily
○
Often (a few times a week)
○
Sometimes (a few times a month)
○
Rarely (a few times a year)
○
Never
●
How important is it to address this need or problem?
○
Not at all important
○
Somewhat important
○
Moderately important
○
Very important
○
Extremely important

3. Design your reward function
Once your team has had a chance to digest your recentresearch on user attitudes towards
automation and augmentation, meet as a team to designyour AI’sreward function. You'll revisit
this exercise as you continue to iterate on your featureand uncover new insights about how your
AI performs.
Use the template below to list out instances of eachreward function dimension.

4. Define success criteria
Now that you've done the work to understand whetherAI is a good fit for your user need and
identified the tradeoffs of your AI’s reward function,it's time to meet as a team to define
success criteria for your feature. Your team may comeup with multiple metrics for success by
the end of this exercise.
By the end of this exercise, everyone on the teamshould feel aligned on what success looks like
for your feature, and how to alert the team if thereis evidence that your feature is failing to meet
the success criteria.
Success metrics framework
Start with this template and try a few different versions:
If__{ specific success metric }__
for__ { your team’s specific AI driven feature }__
{ drops below/goes above }__ { meaningful threshold}__
we will__{ take a specific action }__.
Version 1
Version 2

User needs + defining success
Version 3
Statement iteration
Take each version through this checklist:
Is this metric meaningful for all of our users?
How might this metric negatively impact some of ourusers?
Is this what success means for our feature on day1?
What about day 1,000?
Final version
Schedule regular reviews
Once you've agreed upon your success metric(s), puttime on the calendar to hold your team
accountable to regularly evaluate whether your featureis progressing towards and meeting your
defined criteria.
