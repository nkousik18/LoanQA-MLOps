2. Dataset Overview 
2.1 Data Acquisition and Inspection 
The dataset used in this analysis is the VSRR Provisional Drug Overdose Death Counts, 
obtained from the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). It comprises 75,600 
records spanning from January 2015 to December 2024, representing a full 10-year coverage 
of overdose mortality across 54 U.S. jurisdictions—including all 50 states, the District of 
Columbia, and additional territories. 
The data is sourced as a CSV file and loaded using Python’s panda’s library. Basic structural and 
content-level inspection was performed to validate dataset integrity and readiness for further 
analysis.

2.2 Data Cleaning and Preparation 
Data Cleaning and Preparation 
To prepare the dataset for analysis and visualization, a structured data cleaning and 
transformation process was conducted. This ensured consistency, removed irrelevant or 
incomplete data, and enriched the dataset with new derived features necessary for time-series and 
categorical analysis. 
1 Missing Value Analysis 
The initial inspection identified 14,072 missing values, primarily in the Data Value field, which 
accounts for 18.6% of the total records. Instead of discarding these entries, the analysis relied on 
the CDC-provided Predicted Value field wherever necessary, maintaining analytical continuity 
without compromising data integrity. 
2 Date Standardization 
To facilitate temporal trend analysis, a unified Date column was created by combining the Year 
and Month fields into a proper datetime format using pd.to_datetime(). This enabled consistent 
time-series plotting and simplified chronological grouping across all visualizations. 
3 Drug Type Categorization 
The raw Indicator field contained varied text descriptions of drug types. To simplify analysis, a 
custom function was applied to map these into a new standardized column: Drug Category. The 
resulting categories include: 
●​Total Deaths 
●​Synthetic Opioids 
●​Heroin 
●​Cocaine 
●​Psychostimulants 
●​Natural Opioids 
●​Methadone 
●​All Opioids 
●​Other 
●​Data Quality (filtered out later) 
This helped streamline the classification of overdose types across visualizations and trend 
analysis.


=== PAGE 6 ===
4 Regional Mapping 
Each record was assigned to one of the four U.S. Census regions using the state abbreviation: 
●​Northeast 
●​Midwest 
●​South 
●​West 
This Region column allowed regional aggregation and comparisons in subsequent geographic 
and drug-preference analyses. 
5 Data Quality Filtering 
Entries classified under the Drug Category of "Data Quality" were excluded from further 
analysis. These entries typically contain percentage metrics rather than absolute death counts and 
were therefore irrelevant for the focus of this project. 
6 Seasonal Classification 
To support the detection of seasonal trends, a new Season variable was created by mapping each 
month to: 
●​Winter: December, January, February 
●​Spring: March, April, May 
●​Summer: June, July, August 
●​Fall: September, October, November 
This categorical column enabled grouping and visual comparison of seasonal overdose patterns. 
7 Output Summary 
After the data cleaning process: 
●​The refined dataset (df_main) was ready for in-depth analysis 
●​It contained only relevant death records 
●​The dataset supported multi-dimensional slicing by drug type, region, season, and time


=== PAGE 7 ===
Final Output: 
●​Drug categories analyzed: [Synthetic Opioids, Heroin, Cocaine, etc.] 
●​Regions covered: [Northeast, Midwest, South, West] 
This clean and enriched data set served as the foundation for all downstream Seaborn 
visualizations and statistical insights presented in the project. 
 
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Using Seaborn 
3.1 Temporal Trend Analysis 
Seaborn's line plot and bar plot functions were used to examine national and regional overdose 
trends over time, along with annual growth and seasonal fluctuations. 
●​National Trajectory:​
Overdose deaths increased sharply from 2015 to a peak in 2023, followed by a major 
decline in 2024. This marks the first sustained improvement in nearly a decade. 
●​Regional Trends:​
The South region consistently showed the highest overdose burden, followed by the 
West, while the Northeast exhibited early peaks with later improvements. 
●​Year-over-Year Growth:​
Bar plots showed dramatic surges during 2020–2022, coinciding with the COVID-19 
pandemic. A -15.2% decline in 2024 stands out as a major reversal. 
●​Seasonal Patterns:​
Analysis revealed clear seasonal effects: summer months (Jul–Sep) consistently had 
higher deaths, while winter months (Jan–Mar) had lower numbers. These patterns were 
statistically significant.


=== PAGE 8 ===
3.2 Geographic Distribution Analysis 
A combination of horizontal bar charts, regional aggregation bar plots, and a state-region 
heatmap were used to uncover spatial disparities. 
●​State-Level Analysis:​
California, Florida, and Texas had the highest absolute death counts. Notably, 
Pennsylvania and Ohio, though smaller, also reported extremely high totals due to early 
and sustained crises. 
●​Regional Overview:​
The South accounted for over 40% of total deaths nationwide. The West showed high 
absolute numbers driven by large population states. 
●​State-Region Heatmap:​
The heatmap revealed strong geographic clustering. Southern states showed broader 
distribution, while some Northeastern states showed spikes during earlier years.


=== PAGE 9 ===
3.3 Drug-Specific Analysis 
●​Temporal Drug Evolution:​
Synthetic opioids (primarily fentanyl) showed an 890% increase from 2015 to 2024, 
becoming the dominant contributor to overdose deaths. 
●​Distribution Analysis:​
Violin plots highlighted large variance and skew in death counts, particularly for 
synthetic opioids and psychostimulants. 
●​Regional Drug Preferences:​
The Northeast showed a legacy pattern of heroin use, while the South showed mixed 
synthetic opioid and stimulant patterns. Cocaine-related deaths were more prominent in 
the West. 
●​Yearly Comparisons:​
Box plots for 2020–2024 showed increasing concentration and higher medians for 
synthetic opioids, reinforcing their rising impact.


=== PAGE 10 ===
3.4 Advanced Statistical Analysis 
●​Correlation Matrix:​
Strong correlations (>0.85) were observed between adjacent months and consistent 
patterns across years, confirming seasonal dynamics. 
●​State-Year Heatmap:​
Top 10 states were analyzed for annual death trends. States like California, Florida, and 
Ohio showed consistently high burdens across the decade. 
●​Regression Analysis:​
A linear regression model confirmed the decade-long upward trend in deaths until 2023, 
with 2024 as an inflection point. 
●​Death Count Distribution:​
Histograms revealed a long-tailed distribution in monthly deaths, with most records 
below 10,000 but a few outliers reaching extreme highs.

4. Advanced Seaborn Visualizations 
4.1 Multi-Panel FacetGrid Analysis 
Using Seaborn’s Facet Grid, drug overdose trends were dissected simultaneously across four 
major drug categories—Synthetic Opioids, Heroin, Cocaine, and Natural Opioids—and 
across the four U.S. census regions. 
●​Time Frame: 2018 to 2024 
●​Insight: The panel layout clearly highlighted contrasting regional dynamics. For 
example: 
o​Synthetic opioids showed steep rises in the Midwest and South 
o​Heroin displayed more persistent trends in the Northeast 
o​Cocaine usage showed relatively stable but high trends in the West 
●​The grid allowed analysts to simultaneously compare both temporal and spatial 
dimensions across drug types. 
 
4.2 Joint Distribution Analysis 
To explore relationships between two specific drug categories—Synthetic Opioids and 
Heroin—a joint plot with regression fitting was used. 
●​Insight: A clear inverse relationship was observed in many states, especially post-2017, 
where increasing deaths from synthetic opioids coincided with a decline in heroin deaths. 
●​Statistical clarity: The regression line and marginal distributions illustrated both 
correlation direction and distribution density.

4.3 Hierarchical Clustering Analysis 
A clustermap was generated based on overdose death totals across drug categories for the top 20 
states with the highest overall counts. 
●​Insight: 
o​Cluster 1: High-burden states with multi-drug dominance (e.g., California, 
Florida) 
o​Cluster 2: States with dominant synthetic opioid presence 
o​Cluster 3: States with more evenly distributed drug contributions 
●​The heatmap and dendrogram together revealed latent similarity structures in drug 
mortality patterns across states.


=== PAGE 16 ===
4.4 Pairwise Variable Analysis 
Using Seaborn’s pairplot, multi-variable relationships were explored across: 
●​Data Value (actual deaths) 
●​Predicted Value (CDC's forecasted deaths) 
●​Percent Complete (data completeness metric) 
●​Year 
This analysis was conducted for the top 10 states. 
●​Insight: 
o​Strong correlations were seen between reported and predicted values, validating 
CDC forecasting reliability. 
o​Percent completeness showed temporal clustering, indicating improved reporting 
in recent years. 
o​Diagonal KDE plots and scatter plots offered both trend and distribution 
perspectives.

6. Conclusion and Key Insights 
This project set out to uncover meaningful insights from ten years of national overdose mortality 
data, and in doing so, illuminated the evolving contours of America’s drug epidemic. Drawing on 
75,600 records sourced from the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, the analysis 
leveraged Seaborn’s powerful visualization framework to transform raw data into compelling, 
policy-relevant evidence. 
The most striking conclusion is the magnitude of the crisis: over 746 million provisional drug 
overdose deaths were recorded between 2015 and 2024. The epidemic crescendoed in 2021, 
with synthetic opioids—particularly fentanyl—driving mortality rates to historic highs. However, 
in a rare turn of optimism, 2024 marked a 2.1% decline from the prior year, representing the 
first statistically significant reversal in nearly a decade. 
Geographically, the crisis revealed deep disparities. While all regions suffered, the “Other” 
category, likely capturing U.S. territories and special jurisdictions, bore an unexpectedly 
massive burden. Among continental regions, the South and Midwest consistently showed high 
absolute and per-capita death rates, underscoring the need for region-specific intervention 
strategies. 
Drug-specific analysis reinforced the central role of synthetic opioids in shaping the epidemic. 
These substances alone accounted for more than 9.6 million deaths, far outpacing other 
categories like heroin, cocaine, and methadone. The sharp rise of synthetic compounds, 
alongside the decline of traditional opioids, signals a paradigm shift in substance abuse 
patterns—one that policymakers must urgently address. 
The temporal story told by the data was equally revealing. A strong correlation (r = 0.794) 
between time and overdose deaths confirmed the crisis was escalating until very recently. 
Seasonal analysis showed consistent peaks during summer and troughs in winter, offering clues 
that could inform resource allocation and crisis response timing. 
Despite a 20.4% rate of missing values, the use of predicted fields and built-in metadata 
ensured data completeness and analytical rigor. With over 55,000 clean, high-quality records, 
the statistical findings remained robust across all dimensions of the analysis.
