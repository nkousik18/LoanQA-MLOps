Accretive,"In both finance and in general lexicon, the term ""accretive"" is the adjective form of the word ""accretion"", which refers to gradual or incremental growth. For example, an acquisition deal may be deemed accretive for the absorbing company, if that deal contributes to an increase in earnings per share."
Accrual Accounting,"Accrual accounting is one of two accounting methods; the other is cash accounting. Accrual accounting measures a company's performance and position by recognizing economic events regardless of when cash transactions occur, whereas cash accounting only records transactions when payment occurs."

Individual companies can also generate income without actually receiving it, which is the basis of the accrual accounting system."
Accrued Liability,The term accrued liability refers to an expense incurred but not yet paid for by a business. These are costs for goods and services already delivered to a company for which it must pay in the future. A company can accrue liabilities for any number of obligations. They may be recorded as either short- or long-term liabilities on the company's balance sheet. They are normally listed on the balance sheet as current expenses and are adjusted at the end of an accounting period.
Accrued Revenue,"Accrued revenue is revenue that has been earned by providing a good or service, but for which no cash has been received. Accrued revenues are recorded as receivables on the balance sheet to reflect the amount of money that customers owe the business for the goods or services they purchased."
Accumulated Depreciation,"Accumulated depreciation is the cumulative depreciation of an asset up to a single point in its life. Accumulated depreciation is a contra asset account, meaning its natural balance is a credit that reduces the overall asset value."
Accumulation Phase,"Accumulation phase has two meanings for investors and those saving for retirement. It refers to the period when an individual is working and planning and ultimately building up the value of their investment through savings. The accumulation phase is then followed by the distribution phase, in which retirees begin accessing and using their funds."
Accumulation/Distribution Indicator (A/D),"The accumulation/distribution indicator (A/D) is a cumulative indicator that uses volume and price to assess whether a stock is being accumulated or distributed. The A/D measure seeks to identify divergences between the stock price and the volume flow. This provides insight into how strong a trend is. If the price is rising but the indicator is falling, then it suggests that buying or accumulation volume may not be enough to support the price rise and a price decline could be forthcoming."
Acid-Test Ratio,"The acid-test ratio, commonly known as the quick ratio, uses a firm's balance sheet data as an indicator of whether it has sufficient short-term assets to cover its short-term liabilities."
Acquisition,"An acquisition is when one company purchases most or all of another company's shares to gain control of that company. Purchasing more than 50% of a target firm's stock and other assets allows the acquirer to make decisions about the newly acquired assets without the approval of the company’s other shareholders. Acquisitions, which are very common in business, may occur with the target company's approval, or in spite of its disapproval. With approval, there is often a no-shop clause during the process."
Acquisition Accounting,"Acquisition accounting is a set of formal guidelines describing how assets, liabilities, non-controlling interest (NCI) and goodwill of a purchased company must be reported by the buyer on its consolidated statement of financial position."
Acquisition Cost,"An acquisition cost, also referred to as the cost of acquisition, is the total cost that a company recognizes on its books for property or equipment after adjusting for discounts, incentives, closing costs and other necessary expenditures, but before sales taxes. An acquisition cost may also entail the amount needed to take over another firm or purchase an existing business unit from another company. Additionally, an acquisition cost can describe the costs incurred by a business in relation to the efforts involved in acquiring a new customer."
Acquisition Premium,An acquisition premium is a figure that's the difference between the estimated real value of a company and the actual price paid to acquire it. An acquisition premium represents the increased cost of buying a target company during a merger and acquisition (M&A) transaction.
Active Management,"The term active management implies that a professional money manager or a team of professionals is tracking the performance of a client's investment portfolio and regularly making buy, hold, and sell decisions about the assets in it. The goal of the active manager is to outperform the overall market."
Activities of Daily Living (ADL),"Activities of daily living (ADLs) are routine activities people do every day without assistance. There are six basic ADLs: eating, bathing, getting dressed, toileting, mobility, and continence. The performance of these ADLs is important in determining what type of long-term care and health coverage, such as Medicare, Medicaid, or long-term care insurance, a person will need as they age.﻿﻿"
Activity-Based Budgeting (ABB),"Activity-based budgeting (ABB) is a system that records, researches, and analyzes activities that lead to costs for a company. Every activity in an organization that incurs a cost is scrutinized for potential ways to create efficiencies. Budgets are then developed based on these results."
Activity-Based Costing (ABC),"Activity-based costing (ABC) is a costing method that assigns overhead and indirect costs to related products and services. This accounting method of costing recognizes the relationship between costs, overhead activities, and manufactured products, assigning indirect costs to products less arbitrarily than traditional costing methods. However, some indirect costs, such as management and office staff salaries, are difficult to assign to a product."
Activity-Based Management (ABM),Activity-based management (ABM) is a system for determining the profitability of every aspect of a business so that its strengths can be enhanced and its weaknesses can either be improved or eliminated altogether.
Activity Cost Driver,"An activity cost driver is an accounting term. A cost driver affects the cost of specific business activities. In activity-based costing (ABC), an activity cost driver influences the costs of labor, maintenance, or other variable costs. Cost drivers are essential in ABC, a branch of managerial accounting that allocates the indirect costs, or overheads, of an activity."
Activity Ratios,"An activity ratio is a type of financial metric that indicates how efficiently a company is leveraging the assets on its balance sheet, to generate revenues and cash. Commonly referred to as efficiency ratios, activity ratios help analysts gauge how a company handles inventory management, which is key to its operational fluidity and overall fiscal health."
Actual Deferral & Actual Contribution Percentage Test (ADP/ACP),The Actual Deferral Percentage (ADP) and Actual Contribution Percentage (ACP) tests are two tests that companies must conduct to ensure that their 401(k) plans don't unfairly benefit highly-paid employees at the expense of others.
Actuarial Gain Or Loss,"Actuarial gain or loss refers to an increase or a decrease in the projections used to value a corporation’s defined benefit pension plan obligations. The actuarial assumptions of a pension plan are directly affected by the discount rate used to calculate the present value of benefit payments and the expected rate of return on plan assets. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) SFAS No. 158 requires the funding status of pension funds to be reported on the plan sponsor’s balance sheet. This means there are periodic updates to the pension obligations, the fund performance and the financial health of the plan.﻿﻿﻿ Depending on plan participation rates, market performance and other factors, the pension plan may experience an actuarial gain or loss in their projected benefit obligation."
Actuarial Life Table,An actuarial life table is a table or spreadsheet that shows the probability of a person at a certain age dying before their next birthday. It is used often by life insurance companies.
Actuarial Science,"Actuarial science is a discipline that assesses financial risks in the insurance and finance fields, using mathematical and statistical methods. Actuarial science applies the mathematics of probability and statistics to define, analyze, and solve the financial implications of uncertain future events. Traditional actuarial science largely revolves around the analysis of mortality and the production of life tables, and the application of compound interest."
Ad Valorem Tax,"An ad valorem tax is a tax based on the assessed value of an item, such as real estate or personal property. The most common ad valorem taxes are property taxes levied on real estate. However, ad valorem taxes may also extend to a number of tax applications, such as import duty taxes on goods from abroad."
Add-On Interest,"Add-on interest is a method of calculating the interest to be paid on a loan by combining the total principal amount borrowed and the total interest due into a single figure, then multiplying that figure by the number of years to repayment. The total is then divided by the number of monthly payments to be made. The result is a loan that combines interest and principal into one amount due."
Additional Child Tax Credit,"The Additional Child Tax Credit was the refundable portion of the Child Tax Credit. It could be claimed by families who owed the IRS less than their qualified Child Tax Credit amount. Since the Child Tax Credit was non-refundable, the Additional Child Tax Credit refunded the unused portion of the Child Tax Credit to the taxpayer. This provision was eliminated from 2018 to 2025 by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).﻿﻿"
Additional Paid-In Capital,"Additional paid-in capital (APIC), is an accounting term referring to money an investor pays above and beyond the par value price of a stock. Often referred to as ""contributed capital in excess of par”, APIC occurs when an investor buys newly-issued shares, directly from a company, during its initial public offering (IPO) stage. Therefore, APICs, which are itemized under the “shareholder’s equity” section of a balance sheet, are viewed as profit opportunities for companies, who receive excess cash from stockholders."
Addition Rule for Probabilities,"The addition rule for probabilities describes two formulas, one for the probability for either of two mutually exclusive events happening and the other for the probability of two non-mutually exclusive events happening."
Adhesion Contract,"An adhesion contract is an agreement where one party has substantially more power than the other in setting the terms of the contract. For a contract of adhesion to exist, the offeror must supply a customer with standard terms and conditions that are identical to those offered to other customers. Those terms and conditions are non-negotiable, meaning the weaker party in the contract must agree to the contract as it is rather than requesting clauses be added, removed, or changed. Adhesion contracts may also be referred to as boilerplate contracts or standard contracts."
Adjudication,"An adjudication is a legal ruling or judgment, usually final, but can also refer to the process of settling a legal case or claim through the court or justice system, such as a decree in the bankruptcy process between the defendant and the creditors."
Adjustable Life Insurance,"Adjustable life insurance is a hybrid of term life and whole life insurance that allows policyholders the option to adjust policy features, including the period of protection, face amount, premiums, and length of the premium payment period."
Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM),"An adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) is a type of mortgage in which the interest rate applied on the outstanding balance varies throughout the life of the loan. With an adjustable-rate mortgage, the initial interest rate is fixed for a period of time. After this initial period of time, the interest rate resets periodically, at yearly or even monthly intervals. ARMs are also called variable-rate mortgages or floating mortgages. The interest rate for ARMs is reset based on a benchmark or index, plus an additional spread called an ARM margin."
Adjusted Closing Price,The adjusted closing price amends a stock's closing price to reflect that stock's value after accounting for any corporate actions. It is often used when examining historical returns or doing a detailed analysis of past performance.
Adjusted EBITDA,"Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) is a measure computed for a company that takes its earnings and adds back interest expenses, taxes, and depreciation charges, plus other adjustments to the metric."
Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO),"Adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) refers to the financial performance measure primarily used in the analysis of real estate investment trusts (REITs). The AFFO of a REIT, though subject to varying methods of computation, is generally equal to the trust's funds from operations (FFO) with adjustments made for recurring capital expenditures used to maintain the quality of the REIT's underlying assets. The calculation takes in the adjustment to GAAP straight-lining of rent, leasing costs, and other material factors."
Adjusted Gross Income (AGI),Adjusted gross income (AGI) is your annual gross income minus certain adjustments that the Internal Revenue Service uses to determine your income tax liability for the year.﻿﻿﻿
Adjusted Present Value (APV),"The adjusted present value is the net present value (NPV) of a project or company if financed solely by equity plus the present value (PV) of any financing benefits, which are the additional effects of debt. By taking into account financing benefits, APV includes tax shields such as those provided by deductible interest."
Adjusting Journal Entry,"An adjusting journal entry is an entry in a company's general ledger that occurs at the end of an accounting period to record any unrecognized income or expenses for the period. When a transaction is started in one accounting period and ended in a later period, an adjusting journal entry is required to properly account for the transaction. Adjusting journal entries can also refer to financial reporting that corrects a mistake made previously in the accounting period."
Administrative Expenses,"Administrative expenses are expenses an organization incurs that are not directly tied to a specific function such as manufacturing, production or sales. These expenses are related to the organization as a whole, as opposed to individual departments or business units. Administrative expenses include salaries of senior executives and costs associated with general services, for example, accounting and information technology. They tend to be unrelated to gross margins."
Administrative Services Only (ASO),"Administrative services only (ASO) refers to an agreement that companies use when they fund their employee benefit plan but hire an outside vendor to administrate it. For example, an organization may hire an insurance company to evaluate and process claims under its employee health plan while maintaining the responsibility of paying the claims itself. An ASO arrangement contrasts with a company that purchases health insurance for its employees from an external provider."
Advance/Decline Line (A/D),"The advance/decline line (A/D) is a technical indicator that plots the difference between the number of advancing and declining stocks on a daily basis. The indicator is cumulative, with a positive number being added to the prior number, or if the number is negative it is subtracted from the prior number."
Advance Payment,"Advance payment is a type of payment made ahead of its normal schedule such as paying for a good or service before you actually receive it. Advance payments are sometimes required by sellers as protection against nonpayment, or to cover the seller's out-of-pocket costs for supplying the service or product."
Advanced Internal Rating-Based (AIRB),An advanced internal rating-based (AIRB) approach to credit risk measurement is a method that requests that all risk components be calculated internally within a financial institution. Advanced internal rating-based (AIRB) can help an institution reduce its capital requirements and credit risk.
Adverse Possession,"The term adverse possession refers to a legal principle that grants title to someone who resides on or is in possession of another person's land. The property's title is granted to the possessor as long as certain conditions are met including whether they infringe on the rights of the actual owner and whether they are in continuous possession of the property. Adverse possession is sometimes called squatter’s rights, although squatter’s rights are a colloquial reference to the idea rather than a recorded law."
Adverse Selection,"Adverse selection refers generally to a situation in which sellers have information that buyers do not have, or vice versa, about some aspect of product quality. In other words, it is a case where asymmetric information is exploited. Asymmetric information, also called information failure, happens when one party to a transaction has greater material knowledge than the other party."
Advertising Budget,"An advertising budget is an estimate of a company's promotional expenditures over a certain time period. More importantly, it is the money a company is willing to set aside to accomplish its marketing objectives. When creating an advertising budget, a company must weigh the value of spending an advertising dollar against the value of that dollar as recognized revenue."
Affiliate,Affiliate is used primarily to describe a business relationship between wherein one company owns less than a majority stake in the other company's stock. Affiliations can also describe a type of relationship in which at least two different companies are subsidiaries of the same larger parent company.
Affiliate Marketing,"Affiliate marketing is an advertising model in which a company compensates third-party publishers to generate traffic or leads to the company’s products and services. The third-party publishers are affiliates, and the commission fee incentivizes them to find ways to promote the company."
Affiliated Companies,"Companies are affiliated when one company is a minority shareholder of another. In most cases, the parent company will own less than a 50% interest in its affiliated company. Two companies may also be affiliated if they are controlled by a separate third party. In the business world, affiliated companies are often simply called affiliates."
Affirmative Action,"Affirmative action is a policy that aims to increase opportunities in the workplace or education to underrepresented parts of society by taking into account an individual's color, race, sex, religion, or national origin."
Affordable Care Act,"The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is the comprehensive healthcare reform signed into law by President Barack Obama in March 2010. Formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and often just called Obamacare, the law includes a list of healthcare policies intended to extend health insurance coverage to millions of uninsured Americans﻿﻿"
After-Tax Real Rate of Return,"The after-tax real rate of return is the actual financial benefit of an investment after accounting for the effects of inflation and taxes. It is a more accurate measure of an investor’s net earnings after income taxes have been paid and the rate of inflation has been adjusted for. Both of these factors will impact the gains an investor receives, and so must be accounted for. This can be contrasted with the gross rate of return and the nominal rate of return of an investment."
After-Hours Trading,"After-hours trading starts at 4 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time after the major U.S. stock exchanges close. The after-hours trading session can run as late as 8 p.m., though volume typically thins out much earlier in the session. Trading in the after-hours is conducted through electronic communication networks (ECNs)."
After-Tax Contribution,"An after-tax contribution is money paid into a retirement or investment account after income taxes on those earnings have already been deducted. When opening a tax-advantaged retirement account, an individual may choose to defer the income taxes owed until after retiring, if it is a so-called traditional retirement account, or pay the income taxes in the year in which the payment is made, if it is a Roth retirement account."
After-Tax Income,"After-tax income is the net income after the deduction of all federal, state, and withholding taxes. After-tax income, also called income after taxes, represents the amount of disposable income that a consumer or firm has available to spend."
Agency Bond,An agency bond is a security issued by a government-sponsored enterprise or by a federal government department other than the U.S. Treasury. Some are not fully guaranteed in the same way that U.S. Treasury and municipal bonds are. An agency bond is also known as agency debt.
Agency by Necessity,"Agency by necessity is a type of legal relationship in which one party can make essential decisions for another party. The courts recognize agency by necessity during an emergency or urgent situation under which the beneficiary is unable to provide explicit authorization. Under such circumstances, those granted agency must act for the sole benefit of the beneficiary."
Agency Problem,"The agency problem is a conflict of interest inherent in any relationship where one party is expected to act in another's best interests. In corporate finance, the agency problem usually refers to a conflict of interest between a company's management and the company's stockholders. The manager, acting as the agent for the shareholders, or principals, is supposed to make decisions that will maximize shareholder wealth even though it is in the manager’s best interest to maximize his own wealth."
Agency Theory,"Agency theory is a principle that is used to explain and resolve issues in the relationship between business principals and their agents. Most commonly, that relationship is the one between shareholders, as principals, and company executives, as agents."
Agent,"An agent, in legal terminology, is a person who has been legally empowered to act on behalf of another person or an entity. An agent may be employed to represent a client in negotiations and other dealings with third parties. The agent may be given decision-making authority."
Aggregate Demand,Aggregate demand is an economic measurement of the total amount of demand for all finished goods and services produced in an economy. Aggregate demand is expressed as the total amount of money exchanged for those goods and services at a specific price level and point in time.
Aggregate Stop-Loss Insurance,"Aggregate stop-loss insurance is a policy designed to limit claim coverage (losses) to a specific amount. This coverage ensures that a catastrophic claim (specific stop-loss) or numerous claims (aggregate stop-loss) do not drain the financial reserves of a self-funded plan. Aggregate stop-loss protects the employer against claims that are higher than expected. If total claims exceed the aggregate limit, the stop-loss insurer covers the claims or reimburses the employer."
Aggregate Supply,"Aggregate supply, also known as total output, is the total supply of goods and services produced within an economy at a given overall price in a given period. It is represented by the aggregate supply curve, which describes the relationship between price levels and the quantity of output that firms are willing to provide. Typically, there is a positive relationship between aggregate supply and the price level."
Aggregation,"Aggregation in the futures markets is a process that combines of all futures positions owned or controlled by a single trader or group of traders into one aggregate position. Aggregation in a financial planning sense, however, is a time-saving accounting method that consolidates an individual’s financial data from various institutions."
Aggressive Investment Strategy,"An aggressive investment strategy typically refers to a style of portfolio management that attempts to maximize returns by taking a relatively higher degree of risk. Strategies for achieving higher than average returns typically emphasize capital appreciation as a primary investment objective, rather than income or safety of principal. Such a strategy would therefore have an asset allocation with a substantial weighting in stocks and possibly little or no allocation to bonds or cash."
Agribusiness Definition,Agribusiness is the business sector encompassing farming and farming-related commercial activities.
Air Waybill (AWB),"An air waybill (AWB) is a document that accompanies goods shipped by an international air courier to provide detailed information about the shipment and allow it to be tracked. The bill has multiple copies so that each party involved in the shipment can document it. An air waybill (AWB), also known as an air consignment note, is a type of bill of lading. However, an AWB serves a similar function to ocean bills of lading, but an AWB is issued in non-negotiable form, meaning there's less protection with an AWB versus bills of lading."
Aktiengesellschaft (AG),"AG is an abbreviation of Aktiengesellschaft, which is a German term for a public limited company. This type of company shares are offered to the general public and traded on a public stock exchange. Shareholders' liability is limited to their investment. The shareholders are not responsible for the company's debts, and their assets are protected in case the company becomes insolvent."
Alan Greenspan,"Alan Greenspan is an American economist who was the chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (Fed), the United States' central bank, from 1987 until 2006. In that role, he also served as the chair of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which is the Fed’s principal monetary policymaking committee that makes decisions on interest rates and managing the U.S. money supply."
Aleatory Contract,"An aleatory contract is an agreement whereby the parties involved do not have to perform a particular action until a specific, triggering event occurs. Events are those that cannot be controlled by either party, such as natural disasters and death. Aleatory contracts are commonly used in insurance policies. For example, the insurer does not have to pay the insured until an event, such as a fire that results in property loss. Aleatory contracts—also called aleatory insurance—are helpful because they typically help the purchaser reduce financial risk."
Algorithmic Trading,"Algorithmic trading is a process for executing orders utilizing automated and pre-programmed trading instructions to account for variables such as price, timing and volume. An algorithm is a set of directions for solving a problem. Computer algorithms send small portions of the full order to the market over time."
All Risks,"All risks refers to a type of insurance coverage that automatically covers any risk that the contract does not explicitly omit. For example, if an ""all risk"" homeowner's policy does not expressly exclude flood coverage, then the house will be covered in the event of flood damage."
Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses (ALAE),Allocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE) are attributed to the processing of a specific insurance claim. ALAE is part of an insurer’s expense reserves. It is one of the largest expenses for which an insurer has to set aside funds—along with contingent commissions.
Allocational Efficiency,"Allocational efficiency, also known as allocative efficiency, is a characteristic of an efficient market where capital is assigned in a way that is most beneficial to the parties involved."
Allotment,An allotment commonly refers to the allocation of shares granted to a participating underwriting firm during an initial public offering (IPO). Remaining surpluses go to other firms that have won the bid for the right to sell the remaining IPO shares. There are several types of allotment that arise when new shares are issued and allocated to either new or existing shareholders.
Allowance for Bad Debt,"An allowance for bad debt is a valuation account used to estimate the amount of a firm's receivables that may ultimately be uncollectible. It is also known as an allowance for doubtful accounts. When a borrower defaults on a loan, the allowance for bad debt account and the loan receivable balance are both reduced for the book value of the loan."
Allowance for Credit Losses,Allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the debt that a company is unlikely to recover. It is taken from the perspective of the selling company that extends credit to its buyers.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts,"An allowance for doubtful accounts is a contra account that nets against the total receivables presented on the balance sheet to reflect only the amounts expected to be paid. The allowance for doubtful accounts estimates the percentage of accounts receivable that are expected to be uncollectible. However, the actual payment behavior of customers may differ substantially from the estimate."
Alpha,"Alpha (α) is a term used in investing to describe an investment strategy's ability to beat the market, or its ""edge."" Alpha is thus also often referred to as “excess return” or “abnormal rate of return,” which refers to the idea that markets are efficient, and so there is no way to systematically earn returns that exceed the broad market as a whole. Alpha is often used in conjunction with beta (the Greek letter β), which measures the broad market's overall volatility or risk, known as systematic market risk."
Alphabet Stock,"An alphabet stock refers to a separate class of common stock that is tied to a specific subsidiary of a corporation. More broadly, it refers to shares of common stock that are distinguished in some way from other common stock of the same company."
Altcoin,"Altcoins are cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. They share characteristics with Bitcoin but are also different from them in other ways. For example, some altcoins use a different consensus mechanism to produce blocks or validate transactions. Or, they distinguish themselves from Bitcoin by providing new or additional capabilities, such as smart contracts or low-price volatility."
Alternative Depreciation System (ADS),"An alternative depreciation system (ADS) is one of the methods the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires taxpayers to use to determine the depreciation allowed on business assets. An ADS has a depreciation schedule with a longer recovery period that generally better mirrors the asset's income streams than declining balance depreciation. If the taxpayer elects to use an alternative depreciation system, they must apply it to all property of the same class placed in service during the same year."
Alternative Investment,"An alternative investment is a financial asset that does not fall into one of the conventional investment categories. Conventional categories include stocks, bonds, and cash. Alternative investments include private equity or venture capital, hedge funds, managed futures, art and antiques, commodities, and derivatives contracts.

Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT),"An alternative minimum tax (AMT) places a floor on the percentage of taxes that a filer must pay to the government, no matter how many deductions or credits the filer may claim."
Alternative Trading System (ATS),An alternative trading system (ATS) is a trading venue that is more loosely regulated than an exchange. ATS platforms are often used to match large buy and sell orders among its subscribers. The most widely used type of ATS in the United States are electronic communication networks (ECNs)—computerized systems that automatically match buy and sell orders for securities in the market.
Altman Z-Score,The Altman Z-score is the output of a credit-strength test that gauges a publicly-traded manufacturing company's likelihood of bankruptcy.
Always Be Closing (ABC),"Always Be Closing (ABC) is a motivational phrase used to describe a sales strategy. It implies that a salesperson following the regimen should continuously look for new prospects, pitch products or services to those prospects, and ultimately complete a sale."
Amalgamation,"An amalgamation is a combination of two or more companies into a new entity. Amalgamation is distinct from a merger because neither company involved survives as a legal entity. Instead, a completely new entity is formed to house the combined assets and liabilities of both companies."
Amended Return,"An amended return is a form filed in order to make corrections to a tax return from a previous year. An amended return can be used to correct errors and claim a more advantageous tax status—such as a refund. For example, one might choose to file an amended return in instances of misreported earnings or tax credits. Mathematical errors, however, would not require amendments, as the IRS would automatically correct for such errors."
American Depositary Receipt (ADR),An American depositary receipt (ADR) is a negotiable certificate issued by a U.S. depositary bank representing a specified number of shares—often one share—of a foreign company's stock. The ADR trades on U.S. stock markets as any domestic shares would.
American Depositary Share (ADS),An American depositary share (ADS) is an equity share of a non-U.S. company that is held by a U.S. depositary bank and is available for purchase by U.S. investors.
American Dream,"The American dream is the belief that anyone, regardless of where they were born or what class they were born into, can attain their own version of success in a society in which upward mobility is possible for everyone. The American dream is believed to be achieved through sacrifice, risk-taking, and hard work, rather than by chance."
American Express Card,"An American Express card, also known as an “Amex” card, is an electronic payment card branded by the publicly traded financial services company American Express (AXP). The company issues and processes prepaid, charge, and credit cards. American Express cards are available to individuals, small businesses, and corporate consumers across the United States and around the world."

American Stock Exchange (AMEX),"The American Stock Exchange (AMEX) was once the third-largest stock exchange in the United States, as measured by trading volume. The exchange, at its height, handled about 10% of all securities traded in the U.S."
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),"The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities and guarantees that they have equal opportunity to participate in mainstream American life. Passed in 1990, this federal law made it illegal to discriminate against a disabled person in terms of employment opportunities, access to transportation, public accommodations, communications, and government activities."
Amortizable Bond Premium,"The amortizable bond premium is a tax term that refers to the excess price paid for a bond over and above its face value. Depending on the type of bond, the premium can be tax-deductible and amortized over the life of the bond on a pro-rata basis."
Amortization of Intangibles,Amortization of intangibles is the process of expensing the cost of an intangible asset over the projected life of the asset for tax or accounting purposes. The amortization process for corporate accounting purposes may differ from the amount of amortization posted for tax purposes.
Amortization Schedule,"An amortization schedule is a complete table of periodic loan payments, showing the amount of principal and the amount of interest that comprise each payment until the loan is paid off at the end of its term. Each periodic payment is the same amount in total for each period. However, early in the schedule, the majority of each payment is what is owed in interest; later in the schedule, the majority of each payment covers the loan's principal. The last line of the schedule shows the borrower’s total interest and principal payments for the entire loan term."
Amortization,"Amortization is an accounting technique used to periodically lower the book value of a loan or intangible asset over a set period of time. In relation to a loan, amortization focuses on spreading out loan payments over time. When applied to an asset, amortization is similar to depreciation."
Amortized Bond,"An amortized bond is one in which the principal (face value) on the debt is paid down regularly, along with its interest expense over the life of the bond. A fixed-rate residential mortgage is one common example because the monthly payment remains constant over its life of, say, 30 years. However, each payment represents a slightly different percentage mix of interest versus principal. An amortized bond is different from a balloon or bullet loan, where there is a large portion of the principal that must be repaid only at its maturity."
Amortized Loan,"An amortized loan is a type of loan with scheduled, periodic payments that are applied to both the loan's principal amount and the interest accrued. An amortized loan payment first pays off the relevant interest expense for the period, after which the remainder of the payment is put toward reducing the principal amount. Common amortized loans include auto loans, home loans, and personal loans from a bank for small projects or debt consolidation."
Amsterdam Stock Exchange (AEX),"Founded in 1602, along with the creation of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), the Amsterdam Stock Exchange is considered the oldest, still-functioning stock exchange in the world."
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA),"Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is an analysis tool used in statistics that splits an observed aggregate variability found inside a data set into two parts: systematic factors and random factors. The systematic factors have a statistical influence on the given data set, while the random factors do not. Analysts use the ANOVA test to determine the influence that independent variables have on the dependent variable in a regression study."
Android Operating System,"The Android operating system is a mobile operating system that was developed by Google (GOOGL​) to be primarily used for touchscreen devices, cell phones, and tablets. Its design lets users manipulate the mobile devices intuitively, with finger movements that mirror common motions, such as pinching, swiping, and tapping. Google also employs Android software in televisions, cars, and wristwatches—each of which is fitted with a unique user interface."
Anchoring,"Anchoring is a heuristic revealed by behavioral finance that describes the subconscious use of irrelevant information, such as the purchase price of a security, as a fixed reference point (or anchor) for making subsequent decisions about that security. Thus, people are more likely to estimate the value of the same item higher if the suggested sticker price is $100 than if it is $50."
Anchoring and Adjustment,"Anchoring and adjustment is a phenomenon wherein an individual bases their initial ideas and responses on one point of information and makes changes driven by that starting point. The anchoring and adjustment heuristic describes cases in which a person uses a specific target number or value as a starting point, known as an anchor, and subsequently adjusts that information until an acceptable value is reached over time. Often, those adjustments are inadequate and remain too close to the original anchor, which is a problem when the anchor is very different from the true answer."
Angel Investor,"An angel investor (also known as a private investor, seed investor or angel funder) is a high-net-worth individual who provides financial backing for small startups or entrepreneurs, typically in exchange for ownership equity in the company. Often, angel investors are found among an entrepreneur's family and friends. The funds that angel investors provide may be a one-time investment to help the business get off the ground or an ongoing injection to support and carry the company through its difficult early stages."
Animal Spirits,"Animal spirits is a term coined by the famous British economist, John Maynard Keynes, to describe how people arrive at financial decisions, including buying and selling securities, in times of economic stress or uncertainty. In Keynes’s 1936 publication, The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, he speaks of animal spirits as the human emotions that affect consumer confidence."
Annual Equivalent Rate (AER),The annual equivalent rate (AER) is the interest rate for a savings account or investment product that has more than one compounding period. AER is calculated under the assumption that any interest paid is included in the principal payment's balance and the next interest payment will be based on the slightly higher account balance.
Annual General Meeting (AGM),"An annual general meeting (AGM) is a yearly gathering of a company's interested shareholders. At an AGM, the directors of the company present an annual report containing information for shareholders about the company's performance and strategy."
Annual Percentage Rate (APR),"The term “annual percentage rate (APR)” refers to the annual rate of interest charged to borrowers and paid to investors. APR is expressed as a percentage that represents the actual yearly cost of funds over the term of a loan or income earned on an investment. This includes any fees or additional costs associated with the transaction, but it does not take compounding into account. The APR provides consumers with a bottom-line number they can easily compare with rates from other lenders.﻿﻿"
Annual Percentage Yield (APY),The annual percentage yield (APY) is the real rate of return earned on a savings deposit or investment taking into account the effect of compounding interest.
Annual Report,"An annual report is a document that public corporations must provide annually to shareholders that describes their operations and financial conditions. The front part of the report often contains an impressive combination of graphics, photos, and an accompanying narrative, all of which chronicle the company's activities over the past year and may also make forecasts about the future of the company. The back part of the report contains detailed financial and operational information."
Annual Return,"The annual return is the return that an investment provides over a period of time, expressed as a time-weighted annual percentage. Sources of returns can include dividends, returns of capital and capital appreciation. The rate of annual return is measured against the initial amount of the investment and represents a geometric mean rather than a simple arithmetic mean."
Annual Turnover,"Annual turnover is the percentage rate at which something changes ownership over the course of a year. For a business, this rate could be related to its yearly turnover in inventories, receivables, payables, or assets."
Annualize,"To annualize a number means to convert a short-term calculation or rate into an annual rate. Typically, an investment that yields a short-term rate of return is annualized to determine an annual rate of return, which may also include compounding or reinvestment of interest and dividends. It helps to annualize a rate of return to better compare the performance of one security versus another."
Annualized Income,"Annualized income is an estimate of the sum of money that an individual or a business generates over a year's time. Annualized income is calculated with less than one year's worth of data, so it is only an approximation of total income for the year. Annualized income figures can be helpful for creating budgets and making estimated income tax payments."
Annualized Income Installment Method,"The annualized income installment method calculates a taxpayers' estimated tax installment payments and helps to decrease underpayment and penalties incurred due to their fluctuating income. Taxpayers must pay quarterly installments of their estimated tax in amounts figured by the regular installment method. When a taxpayer has a fluctuating income it often causes them to underpay on the quarterly estimates leading to underpayment penalties. Through the use of the annualized income installment method, taxpayers may more accurately estimate their taxes.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿"
Annualized Rate of Return,"An annualized rate of return is calculated as the equivalent annual return an investor receives over a given period. The Global Investment Performance Standards dictate that returns of portfolios or composites for periods of less than one year may not be annualized. This prevents ""projected"" performance in the remainder of the year from occurring."
Annualized Total Return,An annualized total return is the geometric average amount of money earned by an investment each year over a given time period. The annualized return formula is calculated as a geometric average to show what an investor would earn over a period of time if the annual return was compounded. An annualized total return provides only a snapshot of an investment's performance and does not give investors any indication of its volatility or price fluctuations.
Annuitant,"An annuitant is an individual who is entitled to collect the regular payments of a pension or an annuity investment. The annuitant may be the contract holder or another person, such as a surviving spouse. Annuities are generally seen as retirement income supplements. They may be tied to an employee pension plan or a life insurance product. The size of the payments is usually determined by the life expectancy of the annuitant as well as the amount invested."
Annuitization,Annuitization is the process of converting an annuity investment into a series of periodic income payments. Annuities may be annuitized for a specific period or for the life of the annuitant. Annuity payments may only be made to the annuitant or to the annuitant and a surviving spouse in a joint life arrangement. Annuitants can arrange for beneficiaries to receive a portion of the annuity balance upon their death.
Annuity,"Annuities are contracts issued and distributed (or sold) by financial institutions where the funds are invested with the goal of paying out a fixed income stream later on. They are mainly used for retirement purposes and help individuals address the risk of outliving their savings. Upon annuitization, the holding institution will issue a stream of payments at a later point in time."
Annuity Due,"An annuity due is an annuity whose payment is due immediately at the beginning of each period. A common example of an annuity due payment is rent, as landlords often require payment upon the start of a new month as opposed to collecting it after the renter has enjoyed the benefits of the apartment for an entire month."
Annuity Table,"An annuity table is a tool for determining the present value of an annuity or other structured series of payments. Such a tool, used by accountants, actuaries, and other insurance personnel, takes into account how much money has been placed into an annuity and how long it has been there to determine how much money would be due to an annuity buyer or annuitant."
Anomaly,"In economics and finance, an anomaly is when the actual result under a given set of assumptions is different from the expected result predicted by a model. An anomaly provides evidence that a given assumption or model does not hold up in practice. The model can either be a relatively new or older model."
Anti-Dilution Provision,"Anti-dilution provisions are clauses built into convertible preferred stocks and some options to help shield investors from their investment potentially losing value. When new issues of a stock hit the market at a cheaper price than that paid by earlier investors in the same stock, then equity dilution can occur. Anti-dilution provisions are also referred to as anti-dilution clauses, subscription rights, subscription privileges, or preemptive rights."
Anti-Dumping Duty,An anti-dumping duty is a protectionist tariff that a domestic government imposes on foreign imports that it believes are priced below fair market value. Dumping is a process wherein a company exports a product at a price that is significantly lower than the price it normally charges in its home (or its domestic) market.
Anti Money Laundering (AML),"Anti-money laundering (AML) refers to the laws, regulations and procedures intended to prevent criminals from disguising illegally obtained funds as legitimate income."
Anticipatory Breach,An anticipatory breach of contract is an action that shows one party's intention to fail to fulfill its contractual obligations to another party. An anticipatory breach ends the counterparty's responsibility to perform its duties.
Antitrust,"Antitrust laws are regulations that encourage competition by limiting the market power of any particular firm. This often involves ensuring that mergers and acquisitions don't overly concentrate market power or form monopolies, as well as breaking up firms that have become monopolies. Antitrust laws also prevent multiple firms from colluding or forming a cartel to limit competition through practices such as price fixing. Due to the complexity of deciding what practices will limit competition, antitrust law has become a distinct legal specialization."
Appellate Courts,"Appellate courts, also known as the court of appeals, are the part of the American judicial system that is responsible for hearing and reviewing appeals from legal cases that have already been heard in a trial-level or other lower court."
Applicable Federal Rate (AFR),The applicable federal rate (AFR) is the minimum interest rate that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allows for private loans. Each month the IRS publishes a set of interest rates that the agency considers the minimum market rate for loans. Any interest rate that is less the AFR would have tax implications. The IRS publishes these rates in accordance with Section 1274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code.﻿﻿
Application Programming Interface (API),"An application programming interface (API) is a set of programming code that queries data, parses responses, and sends instructions between one software platform and another. APIs are used extensively in providing data services across a range of fields and contexts."
Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC),"An application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) is a type of circuit that has been designed for a single specific purpose. An ASIC miner refers to a device that uses microprocessors for the sole purpose of ""mining"" digital currency. Generally, each ASIC miner is constructed to mine a specific digital currency. So, a bitcoin ASIC miner can mine only bitcoin. One way to think about bitcoin ASICs is as specialized bitcoin mining computers, or “bitcoin generators,"" that are optimized to solve the mining algorithm."
Applied Economics,"Applied economics applies the conclusions drawn from economic theories and empirical studies to real-world situations with the desired aim of informing economic decisions and predicting possible outcomes. The purpose of applied economics is to improve the quality of practice in business, public policy, and daily life by thinking rigorously about costs and benefits, incentives, and human behavior. Applied economics can involve the use of case studies and econometrics, which is the application of real-world data to statistical models and comparing the results against the theories being tested."
Appraisal,"An appraisal is a valuation of property, such as real estate, a business, collectible, or an antique, by the estimate of an authorized person. The authorized appraiser must have a designation from a regulatory body governing the jurisdiction of the appraiser. Appraisals are typically used for insurance and taxation purposes or to determine a possible selling price for an item or property."
Appraisal Costs,Appraisal costs are a specific category of quality control costs. Companies pay appraisal costs as part of the quality control process to ensure that their products and services meet customer expectations and regulatory requirements. These costs could include expenses for field tests and inspections.
Appraisal Management Company (AMC),"An Appraisal Management Company, or AMC, is an independent entity through which mortgage lenders order residential real estate valuation services for properties on which they are considering extending loans to homebuyers. AMCs fulfill an administrative function in the appraisal process, including selecting an appraiser and delivering the appraisal report to the lender. Individual appraisers who work for AMCs provide the actual property valuation services."
Appropriation,"Appropriation is when money is set aside money for a specific and particular purpose or purposes. A company or a government appropriates funds in order to delegate cash for the necessities of its business operations. Appropriations for the U.S. federal government are decided by Congress through various committees. A company might appropriate money for short-term or long-term needs that include employee salaries, research and development, and dividends."
Appropriation Account,"Appropriation is the act of setting aside money for a specific purpose. In accounting, it refers to a breakdown of how a firm’s profits are divided up, or for the government, an account that shows the funds a government department has been credited with. A company or a government appropriates funds in order to delegate cash for the necessities of its business operations."
Aptitude Test,"An aptitude test is an exam used to determine an individual's skill or propensity to succeed in a given activity. Aptitude tests assume that individuals have inherent strengths and weaknesses, and have a natural inclination toward success or failure in specific areas based on their innate characteristics."
Arab League,"The Arab League, officially the League of Arab States, is a union of Arabic-speaking African and Asian countries. It was formed in Cairo in 1945 to promote the independence, sovereignty, affairs, and interests of its member countries (originally, there were six) and observers."
Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT),"Arbitrage pricing theory (APT) is a multi-factor asset pricing model based on the idea that an asset's returns can be predicted using the linear relationship between the asset’s expected return and a number of macroeconomic variables that capture systematic risk. It is a useful tool for analyzing portfolios from a value investing perspective, in order to identify securities that may be temporarily mispriced."
Arbitration,"Arbitration is a mechanism for resolving disputes between investors and brokers, or between brokers. It is overseen by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the decisions are final and binding. Arbitration is distinct from mediation, in which parties negotiate to reach a voluntary settlement, and decisions are not binding unless all parties agree to them."
Arc Elasticity,Arc elasticity is the elasticity of one variable with respect to another between two given points. It is used when there is no general function to define the relationship between the two variables.
Arithmetic Mean,"The arithmetic mean is the simplest and most widely used measure of a mean, or average. It simply involves taking the sum of a group of numbers, then dividing that sum by the count of the numbers used in the series. For example, take the numbers 34, 44, 56, and 78. The sum is 212. The arithmetic mean is 212 divided by four, or 53."
Arm's Length Transaction,"An arm's length transaction refers to a business deal in which buyers and sellers act independently without one party influencing the other. These types of sales assert that both parties act in their own self-interest and are not subject to pressure from the other party; furthermore, it assures others that there is no collusion between the buyer and seller. In the interest of fairness, both parties usually have equal access to information related to the deal."
Arms Index (TRIN),"The Arms Index, also called the Short-Term Trading Index (TRIN) is a technical analysis indicator that compares the number of advancing and declining stocks (AD Ratio) to advancing and declining volume (AD volume). It is used to gauge overall market sentiment. Richard W. Arms, Jr. invented it in 1967, and it measures the relationship between market supply and demand. It serves as a predictor of future price movements in the market, primarily on an intraday basis. It does this by generating overbought and oversold levels, which indicate when the index (and the majority of stocks in it) will change direction."
Aroon Indicator,"The Aroon indicator is a technical indicator that is used to identify trend changes in the price of an asset, as well as the strength of that trend. In essence, the indicator measures the time between highs and the time between lows over a time period. The idea is that strong uptrends will regularly see new highs, and strong downtrends will regularly see new lows. The indicator signals when this is happening, and when it isn't."
Aroon Oscillator,"The Aroon Oscillator is a trend-following indicator that uses aspects of the Aroon Indicator (Aroon Up and Aroon Down) to gauge the strength of a current trend and the likelihood that it will continue. Readings above zero indicate that an uptrend is present, while readings below zero indicate that a downtrend is present. Traders watch for zero line crossovers to signal potential trend changes. They also watch for big moves, above 50 or below -50 to signal strong price moves."
Arrow's Impossibility Theorem,"Arrow's impossibility theorem is a social-choice paradox illustrating the flaws of ranked voting systems. It states that a clear order of preferences cannot be determined while adhering to mandatory principles of fair voting procedures. Arrow's impossibility theorem, named after economist Kenneth J. Arrow, is also known as the general impossibility theorem."
Article 50,Article 50 is a clause in the European Union's (EU) Lisbon Treaty that outlines the steps to be taken by a country seeking to leave the bloc voluntarily. Invoking Article 50 kick-starts the formal exit process and allows countries to officially declare their intention to leave the EU. The United Kingdom was the first country to invoke Article 50 after a majority of British voters elected to leave the union in 2016.
Articles of Association,"Articles of association form a document that specifies the regulations for a company's operations and defines the company's purpose. The document lays out how tasks are to be accomplished within the organization, including the process for appointing directors and the handling of financial records."
Articles of Incorporation,"Articles of incorporation are a set of formal documents filed with a government body to legally document the creation of a corporation. Articles of incorporation generally contain pertinent information, such as the firm’s name, street address, agent for service of process, and the amount and type of stock to be issued."
Artificial Intelligence (AI),Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.
Ascending Channel,"An ascending channel is the price action contained between upward sloping parallel lines. Higher highs and higher lows characterize this price pattern. Technical analysts construct an ascending channel by drawing a lower trend line that connects the swing lows, and an upper channel line that joins the swing highs."
Ascending Triangle,"An ascending triangle is a chart pattern used in technical analysis. It is created by price moves that allow for a horizontal line to be drawn along the swing highs, and a rising trendline to be drawn along the swing lows. The two lines form a triangle. Traders often watch for breakouts from triangle patterns. The breakout can occur to the upside or downside. Ascending triangles are often called continuation patterns since the price will typically breakout in the same direction as the trend that was in place just prior to the triangle forming."
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC),"The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is an economic group of 21 members, formed in 1989, with the primary goal of promoting free trade and sustainable development in the Pacific Rim economies."
Asian Development Bank,"Founded in 1966, the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) headquarters are in Manila, Philippines. The Asian Development Bank's primary mission is to foster growth and cooperation among countries in the Asia-Pacific Region. The ADB assists its members and partners by providing loans, technical assistance, grants, and equity investments to promote social and economic development."
Asian Financial Crisis,"The Asian financial crisis, also called the ""Asian Contagion,"" was a sequence of currency devaluations and other events that began in the summer of 1997 and spread through many Asian markets. The currency markets first failed in Thailand as the result of the government's decision to no longer peg the local currency to the U.S. dollar (USD). Currency declines spread rapidly throughout East Asia, in turn causing stock market declines, reduced import revenues, and government upheaval."
Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB),The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is a new international development bank that provides financing for infrastructure projects in Asia. It began operations in January 2016.
Ask,"The ask is the price a seller is willing to accept for a security, which is often referred to as the offer price. Along with the price, the ask quote might also stipulate the amount of the security available to be sold at the stated price. The bid is the price a buyer is willing to pay for a security, and the ask will always be higher than the bid."
Assemble to Order (ATO),"Assemble-to-order (ATO) is a business production strategy where products that are ordered by customers are produced quickly and are customizable to a certain extent. It typically requires that the basic parts of the product are already manufactured but not yet assembled. Once an order is received, the parts are assembled quickly and the final product is sent to the customer."
Assessed Value,An assessed value is the dollar value assigned to a property to measure applicable taxes. Assessed valuation determines the value of a residence for tax purposes and takes comparable home sales and inspections into consideration. It is the price placed on a home by the corresponding government municipality to calculate property taxes.
Asset Allocation,"Asset allocation is an investment strategy that aims to balance risk and reward by apportioning a portfolio's assets according to an individual's goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. The three main asset classes - equities, fixed-income, and cash and equivalents - have different levels of risk and return, so each will behave differently over time."
Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP),An asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) is a short-term investment vehicle with a maturity date that is typically between 90 and 270 days. A bank or other financial institution typically issues the security itself. The notes are backed by the company's physical assets such as trade receivables. Companies will use an asset-backed commercial paper to fund short-term financing needs.
Asset-Backed Security (ABS),"An asset-backed security (ABS) is a type of financial investment that is collateralized by an underlying pool of assets—usually ones that generate a cash flow from debt, such as loans, leases, credit card balances, or receivables. It takes the form of a bond or note, paying income at a fixed rate for a set amount of time, until maturity. For income-oriented investors, asset-backed securities can be an alternative to other debt instruments, like corporate bonds or bond funds."
Asset-Based Approach,An asset-based approach is a type of business valuation that focuses on a company's net asset value. The net asset value is identified by subtracting total liabilities from total assets. There is some room for interpretation in terms of deciding which of the company's assets and liabilities to include in the valuation and how to measure the worth of each.
Asset-Based Lending,"Asset-based lending is the business of loaning money in an agreement that is secured by collateral. An asset-based loan or line of credit may be secured by inventory, accounts receivable, equipment, or other property owned by the borrower."
Asset Class,An asset class is a grouping of investments that exhibit similar characteristics and are subject to the same laws and regulations. Asset classes are made up of instruments which often behave similarly to one another in the marketplace.
Asset Coverage Ratio,"The asset coverage ratio is a financial metric that measures how well a company can repay its debts by selling or liquidating its assets. The asset coverage ratio is important because it helps lenders, investors, and analysts measure the financial solvency of a company. Banks and creditors often look for a minimum asset coverage ratio before lending money."
Asset Financing,"Asset financing refers to the use of a company’s balance sheet assets, including short-term investments, inventory and accounts receivable, to borrow money or get a loan. The company borrowing the funds must provide the lender with a security interest in the assets."
Asset-Liability Committee (ALCO),"An asset-liability committee (ALCO), also known as surplus management, is a supervisory group that coordinates the management of assets and liabilities with a goal of earning adequate returns. By managing a company's assets and liabilities, executives are able to influence net earnings, which may translate into increased stock prices."
Asset/Liability Management,Asset/liability management is the process of managing the use of assets and cash flows to reduce the firm’s risk of loss from not paying a liability on time. Well-managed assets and liabilities increase business profits. The asset/liability management process is typically applied to bank loan portfolios and pension plans. It also involves the economic value of equity.
Asset Management,"Asset management is the direction of all or part of a client's portfolio by a financial services institution, usually an investment bank, or an individual. Institutions offer investment services along with a wide range of traditional and alternative product offerings that might not be available to the average investor."
Asset Management Company (AMC),"An asset management company (AMC) is a firm that invests pooled funds from clients, putting the capital to work through different investments including stocks, bonds, real estate, master limited partnerships, and more. Along with high-net-worth individual portfolios, AMCs manage hedge funds and pension plans, and—to better serve smaller investors—create pooled structures such as mutual funds, index funds, or exchange-traded funds, which they can manage in a single centralized portfolio."
Asset Protection,Asset protection is the adoption of strategies to guard one's wealth. Asset protection is a component of financial planning intended to protect one's assets from creditor claims. Individuals and business entities use asset protection techniques to limit creditors' access to certain valuable assets while operating within the bounds of debtor-creditor law.
Asset Swapped Convertible Option Transaction (ASCOT),"An asset swapped convertible option transaction (ASCOT) is a structured investment strategy in which an option on a convertible bond is used to separate a convertible bond into its two components: a fixed income piece and an equity piece. More specifically, the components being separated are the corporate bond with its regular coupon payments and the equity option that functions as a call option."
Asset Turnover Ratio,The asset turnover ratio measures the value of a company's sales or revenues relative to the value of its assets. The asset turnover ratio can be used as an indicator of the efficiency with which a company is using its assets to generate revenue.
Asset Valuation,"Asset valuation is the process of determining the fair market or present value of assets, using book values, absolute valuation models like discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models or comparables. Such assets include investments in marketable securities such as stocks, bonds and options; tangible assets like buildings and equipment; or intangible assets such as brands, patents and trademarks."
Assets Under Management (AUM),Assets under management (AUM) is the total market value of the investments that a person or entity manages on behalf of clients. Assets under management definitions and formulas vary by company.
Assignment,Assignment most often refers to one of two definitions in the financial world:
Assortment Strategies,"An assortment strategy in retailing involves the number and type of products that stores display for purchase by consumers. Also called a ""product assortment strategy,"" it is a strategic tool that retailers use to manage and increase sales. The strategy is comprised of two major components:"
Assumable Mortgage,"An assumable mortgage is a type of financing arrangement whereby an outstanding mortgage and its terms are transferred from the current owner to a buyer. By assuming the previous owner's remaining debt, the buyer can avoid obtaining their own mortgage."
Assurance,"Assurance refers to financial coverage that provides remuneration for an event that is certain to happen. Assurance is similar to insurance, with the terms often used interchangeably. However, insurance refers to coverage over a limited time, whereas assurance applies to persistent coverage for extended periods or until death. Assurance may also apply to validation services provided by accountants and other professionals."
Assurance Services,"Assurance services are a type of independent professional service usually provided by certified or chartered accountants such as certified public accountants (CPAs). Assurance services can include a review of any financial document or transaction, such as a loan, contract, or financial website. This review certifies the correctness and validity of the item being reviewed by the CPA."
Asymmetric Information,"Asymmetric information, also known as ""information failure,"" occurs when one party to an economic transaction possesses greater material knowledge than the other party. This typically manifests when the seller of a good or service possesses greater knowledge than the buyer; however, the reverse dynamic is also possible. Almost all economic transactions involve information asymmetries."
At The Money,"At the money (ATM) is a situation where an option's strike price is identical to the current market price of the underlying security. An ATM option has a delta of ±0.50, positive if it is a call, negative for a put."
Attorney-in-Fact,"An attorney-in-fact is a person who is authorized to act on behalf of another person, usually to perform business or other official transactions. The person represented usually designates someone as their attorney-in-fact by assigning power of attorney."
What Is Attribution Analysis?,"Attribution analysis is a sophisticated method for evaluating the performance of a portfolio or fund manager. Also known as “return attribution” or “performance attribution,” it attempts to quantitatively analyze aspects of an active fund manager’s investment selections and decisions—and to identify sources of excess returns, especially as compared to an index or other benchmark."
Attrition,"The term attrition refers to a gradual but deliberate reduction in staff numbers that occurs as employees retire or resign and are not replaced. It is commonly used to describe downsizing in a firm's employee pool by human resources (HR) professionals. In this case, downsizing is voluntary, where employees either resign or retire and aren't replaced by the company."
Auction Market,"In an auction market, buyers enter competitive bids and sellers submit competitive offers at the same time. The price at which a stock trades represents the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. Matching bids and offers are then paired together, and the orders are executed. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is an example of an auction market."
Audit,The term audit usually refers to a financial statement audit. A financial audit is an objective examination and evaluation of the financial statements of an organization to make sure that the financial records are a fair and accurate representation of the transactions they claim to represent. The audit can be conducted internally by employees of the organization or externally by an outside Certified Public Accountant (CPA) firm.
Audit Committee,An audit committee is one of the major operating committees of a company's board of directors that is in charge of overseeing financial reporting and disclosure.
Audit Risk,"Audit risk is the risk that financial statements are materially incorrect, even though the audit opinion states that the financial reports are free of any material misstatements."
Auditor,"An auditor is a person authorized to review and verify the accuracy of financial records and ensure that companies comply with tax laws. They protect businesses from fraud, point out discrepancies in accounting methods and, on occasion, work on a consultancy basis, helping organizations to spot ways to boost operational efficiency. Auditors work in various capacities within different industries."
Auditor's Opinion,An auditor's opinion is a certification that accompanies financial statements. It is based on an audit of the procedures and records used to produce the statements and delivers an opinion as to whether material misstatements exist in the financial statements. An auditor's opinion may also be called an accountant's opinion.
Auditor's Report,An auditor's report is a written letter from the auditor containing their opinion on whether a company's financial statements comply with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and are free from material misstatement.
Augmented Product,An augmented product has been enhanced by its seller with added features or services to distinguish it from the same product offered by its competitors. Augmenting a product involves including intangible benefits or add-ons that go beyond the product itself.
Austerity,The term austerity refers to a set of economic policies that a government implements in order to control public sector debt. Governments put austerity measures in place when their public debt is so large that the risk of default or the inability to service the required payments on its obligations becomes a real possibility.
Australian Securities Exchange (ASX),"The Australian Securities Exchange is headquartered in Sydney, Australia. The Exchange in its current form was created through the merger of the Australian Stock Exchange and Sydney Futures Exchange in 1999. The ASX acts as a market operator, clearing house, and payments facilitator. It also provides educational materials to retail investors."
Autarky,"Autarky refers to a nation that operates in a state of self-reliance. Nations that follow a policy of autarky are characterized by self-sufficiency and limited trade with global partners. The definition of autarky comes from the Greek—autos, meaning ""self"" and arkein, meaning ""to ward off"" and ""to be strong enough, to suffice."" A fully autarkic nation would be a closed economy and lacking any sources of external support, trade or aid. In practice, however, no modern nation has achieved this level of autarky, even when subjected to punishing sanctions. This is because the global supply chain has made true economic isolation difficult, so any policy of autarky is a matter of degrees rather than a complete isolation."
Authorized Stock,"Authorized stock, or authorized shares, refers to the maximum number of shares that a corporation is legally permitted to issue, as specified in its articles of incorporation in the U.S., or in the company's charter in other parts of the world. It is also usually listed in the capital accounts section of the balance sheet. Authorized shares should not be confused with outstanding shares, which are the number of shares the corporation has actually issued that are held by the public."
Autocorrelation,"Autocorrelation is a mathematical representation of the degree of similarity between a given time series and a lagged version of itself over successive time intervals. It's conceptually similar to the correlation between two different time series, but autocorrelation uses the same time series twice: once in its original form and once lagged one or more time periods."
Automated Clearing House (ACH),"The Automated Clearing House (ACH) Network is an electronic funds-transfer system run by NACHA, formerly called the National Automated Clearing House Association, since 1974. This payment system provides ACH transactions for use with payroll, direct deposit, tax refunds, consumer bills, tax payments, and many more payment services in the U.S."
Automated Customer Account Transfer Service (ACATS),"The Automated Customer Account Transfer Service (ACATS) is a system that facilitates the transfer of securities from one trading account to another at a different brokerage firm or bank. The National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) developed the ACATS system, replacing the previous manual asset transfer system with this fully automated and standardized one."
Automated Teller Machine (ATM),An automated teller machine (ATM) is an electronic banking outlet that allows customers to complete basic transactions without the aid of a branch representative or teller. Anyone with a credit card or debit card can access cash at most ATMs.
Automatic Bill Payment,"An automatic bill payment is a money transfer scheduled on a predetermined date to pay a recurring bill. Automatic bill payments are routine payments made from a banking, brokerage, or mutual fund account to vendors."
Automatic Premium Loan,An automatic premium loan is an insurance policy provision that allows the insurer to deduct the amount of an outstanding premium from the value of the policy when the premium is due. Automatic premium loan provisions are most commonly associated with cash value life insurance policies and allow a policy to continue to be in force rather than lapsing due to nonpayment of the premium.
Automatic Stabilizer,"Automatic stabilizers are a type of fiscal policy designed to offset fluctuations in a nation's economic activity through their normal operation without additional, timely authorization by the government or policymakers."
Autonomous Consumption,"Autonomous consumption is defined as the expenditures that consumers must make even when they have no disposable income. Certain goods need to be purchased, regardless of how much income or money a consumer has in their possession at any given time. When a consumer is low on resources, paying for these necessities can force them to borrow or access money that they had previously been saving."
Autonomous Expenditure,"An autonomous expenditure describes the components of an economy's aggregate expenditure that are not impacted by that same economy's real level of income. This type of spending is considered automatic and necessary, whether occurring at the government level or the individual level. The classical economic theory states that any rise in autonomous expenditures will create at least an equivalent rise in aggregate output, such as GDP, if not a greater increase."
Autoregressive,"A statistical model is autoregressive if it predicts future values based on past values. For example, an autoregressive model might seek to predict a stock's future prices based on its past performance."
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA),"An autoregressive integrated moving average, or ARIMA, is a statistical analysis model that uses time series data to either better understand the data set or to predict future trends."
Available Balance,"The available balance is the balance in checking or on-demand accounts that is free for use by the customer or account holder. These are funds that are available for immediate use, and includes deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and any other activity that has already cleared to or from the account. A credit card account's available balance is normally referred to as available credit."
Available-for-Sale Security,"An available-for-sale security (AFS) is a debt or equity security purchased with the intent of selling before it reaches maturity or holding it for a long period should it not have a maturity date. Accounting standards necessitate that companies classify any investments in debt or equity securities when they are purchased as held-to-maturity, held-for-trading, or available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value; changes in value between accounting periods are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the equity section of the balance sheet."
Average Age Of Inventory,The average age of inventory is the average number of days it takes for a firm to sell off inventory. It is a metric that analysts use to determine the efficiency of sales. The average age of inventory is also referred to as days' sales in inventory (DSI).
Average Annual Growth Rate (AAGR),"The average annual growth rate (AAGR) is the average increase in the value of an individual investment, portfolio, asset, or cash stream over the period of a year."
Average Annual Return (AAR),"The average annual return (AAR) is a percentage used when reporting the historical return, such as the three-, five-, and 10-year average returns of a mutual fund. The average annual return is stated net of a fund's operating expense ratio. Additionally, it does not include sales charges, if applicable, or portfolio transaction brokerage commissions."
Average Inventory,"Average inventory is a calculation that estimates the value or number of a particular good or set of goods during two or more specified time periods. Average inventory is the mean value of inventory within a certain time period, which may vary from the median value of the same data set, and is computed by averaging the starting and ending inventory values over a specified period."
Average Collection Period,The average collection period is the amount of time it takes for a business to receive payments owed by its clients in terms of accounts receivable (AR). Companies calculate the average collection period to make sure they have enough cash on hand to meet their financial obligations.
Average Cost Basis,The average cost basis method is a system of calculating the value of mutual fund positions held in a taxable account to determine the profit or loss for tax reporting. Cost basis represents the initial value of a security or mutual fund that an investor owns.
Average Cost Method,The average cost method assigns a cost to inventory items based on the total cost of goods purchased or produced in a period divided by the total number of items purchased or produced. The average cost method is also known as the weighted-average method.
Average Daily Balance Method,"The average daily balance is a common accounting method that calculates interest charges by considering the balance invested or owed at the end of each day of the billing period, rather than the balance invested or owed at the end of the week, month, or year."
Average Daily Rate (ADR),The average daily rate (ADR) is a metric widely used in the hospitality industry to indicate the average revenue earned for an occupied room on a given day. The average daily rate is one of the key performance indicators (KPI) of the industry.
Average Daily Trading Volume (ADTV),"Average daily trading volume (ADTV) is the average number of shares traded within a day in a given stock. Daily volume is how many shares are traded each day, but this can be averaged over a number of days to find the average daily volume. Average daily trading volume is an important metric because high or low trading volume attracts different types of traders and investors. Many traders and investors prefer higher average daily trading volume compared to low trading volume, because with high volume it is easier to get into and out positions. Low volume assets have fewer buyers and sellers, and therefore it may be harder to enter or exit at a desired price."
Average Directional Index (ADX),The average directional index (ADX) is a technical analysis indicator used by some traders to determine the strength of a trend.
Average Life,"The average life is the length of time the principal of a debt issue is expected to be outstanding. Average life does not take into account interest payments, but only principal payments made on the loan or security. In loans, mortgages, and bonds, the average life is the average period of time before the debt is repaid through amortization or sinking fund payments."
Average Outstanding Balance,"An average outstanding balance is the unpaid, interest-bearing balance of a loan or loan portfolio averaged over a period of time, usually one month. The average outstanding balance can refer to any term, installment, revolving, or credit card debt on which interest is charged. It may also be an average measure of a borrower’s total outstanding balances over a period of time."
Average Propensity to Consume,The average propensity to consume (APC) measures the percentage of income that is spent rather than saved. This may be calculated by a single individual who wants to know where the money is going or by an economist who wants to track the spending and saving habits of an entire nation.
Average Return,"The average return is the simple mathematical average of a series of returns generated over a specified period of time. An average return is calculated the same way that a simple average is calculated for any set of numbers. The numbers are added together into a single sum, then the sum is divided by the count of the numbers in the set."
Average Selling Price (ASP),"The term average selling price (ASP) refers to the price at which a certain class of good or service is typically sold. The average selling price is affected by the type of product and the product life cycle. The ASP is the average selling price of the product across multiple distribution channels, across a product category within a company, or even across the market as a whole."
Average True Range (ATR),"The average true range (ATR) is a technical analysis indicator, introduced by market technician J. Welles Wilder Jr. in his book New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems, that measures market volatility by decomposing the entire range of an asset price for that period.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿"
Axe,"An axe (or ""axe to grind"") is the interest that a trader shows in buying or selling a security that is typically already on the books. If a trader holds a long position but has short-term concerns, that trader’s axe toward short-term put options may be significant. Likewise, if a trader has risk exposure to an increase in interest rates, they may have an axe to hedge against that risk."
Baby Bond,"A baby bond is a fixed income security that is issued in small-dollar denominations, with a par value of less than $1,000. The small denominations enhance the attraction of baby bonds to average retail investors."
Baby Boomer,"Baby boomer is a term used to describe a person who was born between 1946 and 1964. The baby boomer generation makes up a substantial portion of the world's population, especially in developed nations. It represents 21.19% of the population of the United States of America, as of 2019 figures."
Back-End Ratio,"The back-end ratio, also known as the debt-to-income ratio, is a ratio that indicates what portion of a person's monthly income goes toward paying debts. Total monthly debt includes expenses, such as mortgage payments (principal, interest, taxes, and insurance), credit card payments, child support, and other loan payments."
Back Office,"The back office is the portion of a company made up of administration and support personnel who are not client-facing. Back-office functions include settlements, clearances, record maintenance, regulatory compliance, accounting, and IT services. For example, a financial services firm is segmented into three parts: the front office (e.g., sales, marketing, and customer support), the middle office (risk management), and the back office (administrative and support services)."
Back Stop,"A back stop is the act of providing last-resort support or security in a securities offering for the unsubscribed portion of shares. When a company is trying to raise capital through an issuance —and wants to guarantee the amount received through the issue—it may get a back stop from an underwriter or a major shareholder, such as an investment bank, to buy any of its unsubscribed shares."
Back-to-Back Letters of Credit,"Back-to-back letters of credit consist of two letters of credit (LoCs) used together to finance a transaction. A back-to-back letter of credit is usually used in a transaction involving an intermediary between the buyer and seller, such as a broker, or when a seller must purchase the goods it will sell from a supplier as part of the sale to his buyer."
Backdoor Roth IRA,"A backdoor Roth IRA is not an official type of retirement account. Instead, it is an informal name for a complicated but IRS-sanctioned method for high-income taxpayers to fund a Roth, even if their incomes exceed the limits that the IRS allows for regular Roth contributions. Brokerages that offer both traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs provide assistance in pulling off this strategy, which basically involves converting a traditional IRA into the Roth variety."
Backflush Costing,"Backflush costing is a product costing system generally used in a just-in-time (JIT) inventory system. In short, it is an accounting method that records the costs associated with producing a good or service only after they are produced, completed, or sold. Backflush costing is also commonly referred to as backflush accounting."
Backlog,"A backlog is a buildup of work that needs to be completed. The term ""backlog"" has a number of uses in accounting and finance. It may, for example, refer to a company's sales orders waiting to be filled or a stack of financial paperwork, such as loan applications, that needs to be processed."
Backorder,"A backorder is an order for a good or service that cannot be filled at the current time due to a lack of available supply. The item may not be held in the company's available inventory but could still be in production, or the company may need to still manufacture more of the product."
Backtesting,"Backtesting is the general method for seeing how well a strategy or model would have done ex-post. Backtesting assesses the viability of a trading strategy by discovering how it would play out using historical data. If backtesting works, traders and analysts may have the confidence to employ it going forward."
Backup Withholding,"Backup withholding is a tax that is levied on investment income, at an established tax rate, as the investor withdraws it. For payments not subject to withholding, payers are required to withhold the tax. Backup withholding helps to ensure that government tax-collecting agencies, such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or Canada Revenue Agency, will be able to receive income taxes owed to them from investors’ earnings."
Backward Integration,"Backward integration is a form of vertical integration in which a company expands its role to fulfill tasks formerly completed by businesses up the supply chain. In other words, backward integration is when a company buys another company that supplies the products or services needed for production. For example, a company might buy their supplier of inventory or raw materials. Companies often complete backward integration by acquiring or merging with these other businesses, but they can also establish their own subsidiary to accomplish the task. Complete vertical integration occurs when a company owns every stage of the production process, from raw materials to finished goods/services."
Backwardation,"Backwardation is when the current price, or spot price, of an underlying asset is higher than prices trading in the futures market."
Bad Credit,"Bad credit refers to a person's history of failing to pay bills on time, and the likelihood that they will fail to make timely payments in the future. It is often reflected in a low credit score. Companies can also have bad credit based on their payment history and current financial situation."
Bad Debt,"Bad debt is an expense that a business incurs once the repayment of credit previously extended to a customer is estimated to be uncollectible. Bad debt is a contingency that must be accounted for by all businesses that extend credit to customers, as there is always a risk that payment will not be received."
Bad Debt Expense,"A bad debt expense is recognized when a receivable is no longer collectible because a customer is unable to fulfill their obligation to pay an outstanding debt due to bankruptcy or other financial problems. Companies that extend credit to their customers report bad debts as an allowance for doubtful accounts on the balance sheet, which is also known as a provision for credit losses."
Bag Holder,"A bag holder is an informal term used to describe an investor who holds a position in a security that decreases in value until it descends into worthlessness. In most cases, the bag holder stubbornly retains their holding for an extended period, during which time the value of the investment goes to zero."
Bail Bond,"A bail bond is an agreement by a criminal defendant to appear for trial or pay a sum of money set by the court. The bail bond is cosigned by a bail bondsman, who charges the defendant a fee in return for guaranteeing the payment."
Bail-In,"A bail-in provides relief to a financial institution on the brink of failure by requiring the cancellation of debts owed to creditors and depositors. A bail-in is the opposite of a bailout, which involves the rescue of a financial institution by external parties, typically governments, using taxpayers’ money for funding."
Bailout,"A bailout is when a business, an individual, or a government provides money and/or resources (also known as a capital injection) to a failing company. These actions help to prevent the consequences of that business's potential downfall which may include bankruptcy and default on its financial obligations."
Bait and Switch,"Bait and switch is a morally suspect sales tactic that lures customers in with specific claims about the quality or low prices on items that turn out to be unavailable in order to upsell them on a similar, pricier item. It is considered a form of retail sales fraud, though it takes place in other contexts. While many countries have laws against using bait and switch tactics, not all occurrences constitute fraud."
Balance of Trade (BOT),Balance of trade (BOT) is the difference between the value of a country's exports and the value of a country's imports for a given period. Balance of trade is the largest component of a country's balance of payments (BOP). Sometimes the balance of trade between a country's goods and the balance of trade between its services are distinguished as two separate figures.
Balance Sheet,"A balance sheet is a financial statement that reports a company's assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity at a specific point in time, and provides a basis for computing rates of return and evaluating its capital structure. It is a financial statement that provides a snapshot of what a company owns and owes, as well as the amount invested by shareholders."
Balanced Budget,A balanced budget is a situation in financial planning or the budgeting process where total expected revenues are equal to total planned spending. This term is most frequently applied to public sector (government) budgeting. A budget can also be considered balanced in hindsight after a full year's worth of revenues and expenses have been incurred and recorded.
Balanced Fund,"A balanced fund is a mutual fund that typically contains a component of stocks and bonds. A mutual fund is a basket of securities in which investors can purchase. Typically, balanced funds stick to a fixed asset allocation of stocks and bonds, such as 70% stocks and 30% bonds. Bonds are debt instruments that usually pay a stable, fixed rate of return."
Balanced Investment Strategy,"A balanced investment strategy combines asset classes in a portfolio in an attempt to balance risk and return. Typically, balanced portfolios are divided between stocks and bonds, either equally or with a slight tilt, such as 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds. Balanced portfolios may also maintain a small cash or money market component for liquidity purposes."
Balanced Scorecard,"The term balanced scorecard (BSC) refers to a strategic management performance metric used to identify and improve various internal business functions and their resulting external outcomes. Used to measure and provide feedback to organizations, balanced scorecards are common among companies in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Europe. Data collection is crucial to providing quantitative results as managers and executives gather and interpret the information. Company personnel can use this information to make better decisions for the future of their organizations."
Balloon Loan,"A balloon loan is a type of loan that does not fully amortize over its term. Since it is not fully amortized, a balloon payment is required at the end of the term to repay the remaining principal balance of the loan. Balloon loans can be attractive to short-term borrowers because they typically carry lower interest rates than loans with longer terms. However, the borrower must be aware of refinancing risks as there's a risk the loan may reset at a higher interest rate."
Balloon Payment,"A balloon payment is a large payment due at the end of a balloon loan, such as a mortgage, a commercial loan, or another type of amortized loan. It is considered similar to a bullet repayment."
Ballpark Figure,"A ballpark figure is a rough numerical estimate or approximation of the value of something that is otherwise unknown. Ballpark figures are commonly used by accountants, salespersons, and other professionals to estimate current or future results. A stockbroker could use a ballpark figure to estimate how much money a client might have at some point in the future, given a certain rate of growth. A salesperson could use a ballpark figure to estimate how long a product a customer was thinking about buying might be viable."
Baltic Dry Index,"The Baltic Dry Index (BDI) is a shipping and trade index created by the London-based Baltic Exchange. It measures changes in the cost of transporting various raw materials, such as coal and steel."
Bancassurance,"Bancassurance is an arrangement between a bank and an insurance company allowing the insurance company to sell its products to the bank's client base. This partnership arrangement can be profitable for both companies. Banks earn additional revenue by selling insurance products, and insurance companies expand their customer bases without increasing their sales force or paying agent and broker commissions."
Bandwagon Effect,"The bandwagon effect is a psychological phenomenon in which people do something primarily because other people are doing it, regardless of their own beliefs, which they may ignore or override. This tendency of people to align their beliefs and behaviors with those of a group is also called a herd mentality. The term ""bandwagon effect"" originates from politics but has wide implications commonly seen in consumer behavior and investment activities. This phenomenon can be seen during bull markets and the growth of asset bubbles."
Bank,"A bank is a financial institution licensed to receive deposits and make loans. Banks may also provide financial services such as wealth management, currency exchange, and safe deposit boxes. There are several different kinds of banks including retail banks, commercial or corporate banks, and investment banks. In most countries, banks are regulated by the national government or central bank."
Bank Bill Swap Rate (BBSW),"The Bank Bill Swap Rate (BBSW), or Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate, is a short-term interest rate used as a benchmark for the pricing of Australian dollar derivatives and securities—most notably, floating rate bonds."
Bank Capital,"Bank capital is the difference between a bank's assets and its liabilities, and it represents the net worth of the bank or its equity value to investors. The asset portion of a bank's capital includes cash, government securities, and interest-earning loans (e.g., mortgages, letters of credit, and inter-bank loans). The liabilities section of a bank's capital includes loan-loss reserves and any debt it owes. A bank's capital can be thought of as the margin to which creditors are covered if the bank would liquidate its assets."
Bank Confirmation Letter (BCL),"A bank confirmation letter (BCL) is a letter from a bank or financial institution confirming the existence of a loan or a line of credit that has been extended to a borrower. The letter officially vouches for the fact that the borrower—typically an individual, company, or organization—is eligible to borrow a specified amount of funds for a specified purpose."
Bank Credit,"The term bank credit refers to the amount of credit available to a business or individual from a banking institution in the form of loans. Bank credit, therefore, is the total amount of money a person or business can borrow from a bank or other financial institution. A borrower's bank credit depends on their ability to repay any loans and the total amount of credit available to lend by the banking institution. Types of bank credit include car loans, personal loans, and mortgages."
Bank Deposits,"Bank deposits consist of money placed into banking institutions for safekeeping. These deposits are made to deposit accounts such as savings accounts, checking accounts, and money market accounts. The account holder has the right to withdraw deposited funds, as set forth in the terms and conditions governing the account agreement."
Bank Identification Number,"The term bank identification number (BIN) refers to the initial set of four to six numbers that appear on a payment card. This set of numbers identifies the institution that issues the card and is key in the process of matching transactions to the issuer of the charge card. The numbering system applies to credit cards, charge cards, prepaid cards, gift cards, debit cards, prepaid cards, and electronic benefit cards."
What Is a Bank Rating?,"The term bank rating refers to a letter grade or numerical ranking assigned to certain financial institutions by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and credit rating agencies. Bank ratings are given to banks and other thrift institutions. Grades are assigned in order to provide the public with information about an organization's safety and soundness. They also help bank leaders identify problems within their institution, if any, that need to be addressed. Many agencies and companies use a proprietary formula to determine ratings while others use the CAMELS system to assess these financial institutions."
Bank Reserve,Bank reserves are the cash minimums that financial institutions must have on hand in order to meet central bank requirements. This is real paper money that must be kept by the bank in a vault on-site or held in its account at the central bank. Cash reserves requirements are intended to ensure that every bank can meet any large and unexpected demand for withdrawals.
Bank Statement,"A bank statement is a document (also known as an account statement) that is typically sent by the bank to the account holder every month, summarizing all the transactions of an account during the month. Bank statements contain bank account information, such as account numbers and a detailed list of deposits and withdrawals."
Bank Stress Test,"A bank stress test is an analysis conducted under hypothetical scenarios designed to determine whether a bank has enough capital to withstand a negative economic shock. These scenarios include unfavorable situations, such as a deep recession or a financial market crash. In the United States, banks with $50 billion or more in assets are required to undergo internal stress tests conducted by their own risk management teams and the Federal Reserve."
Bank Draft,"The term bank draft refers to a negotiable instrument that can be used as payment just like a check. Unlike a check, though, a bank draft is guaranteed by the issuing bank. The total amount of the draft is drawn from the requesting payer's account—their bank account balance decreases by the money withdrawn from the account—and is usually held in a general ledger account until the draft is cashed by the payee. Bank drafts provide the payee with a secure form of payment."
Bank-Owned Life Insurance (BOLI),Bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) is a form of life insurance purchased by banks where the bank is the beneficiary and also usually the owner of the policy.
Banker's Acceptance,"Banker's acceptance (BA) is a negotiable piece of paper that functions like a post-dated check. A bank, rather than an account holder, guarantees the payment. Banker's acceptances (also known as bills of exchange) are used by companies as a relatively safe form of payment for large transactions. BAs can also be short-term debt instruments, similar to U.S. Treasury bills, that trade at a discount to face value in the money markets."
Bank Guarantee,"A bank guarantee is a type of financial backstop offered by a lending institution. The bank guarantee means that the lender will ensure that the liabilities of a debtor will be met. In other words, if the debtor fails to settle a debt, the bank will cover it. A bank guarantee enables the customer, or debtor, to acquire goods, buy equipment or draw down a loan."
Bank Reconciliation,"A bank reconciliation statement is a summary of banking and business activity that reconciles an entity’s bank account with its financial records. The statement outlines the deposits, withdrawals, and other activities affecting a bank account for a specific period. A bank reconciliation statement is a useful financial internal control tool used to thwart fraud."
Bank Run,A bank run occurs when a large number of customers of a bank or other financial institution withdraw their deposits simultaneously over concerns of the bank's solvency.
Bankruptcy,"Bankruptcy is a legal proceeding involving a person or business that is unable to repay their outstanding debts. The bankruptcy process begins with a petition filed by the debtor, which is most common, or on behalf of creditors, which is less common. All of the debtor's assets are measured and evaluated, and the assets may be used to repay a portion of outstanding debt."
Banner Advertising,"Banner advertising refers to the use of a rectangular graphic display that stretches across the top, bottom, or sides of a website or online media property. The horizontal type of banner advertisement is called a leaderboard, while the vertical banners are called a skyscraper and are positioned on a web page's sidebars. Banner ads are image-based rather than text-based and are a popular form of online advertising."
Baptism by Fire,Baptism by fire is a phrase commonly used to describe a person or employee who is learning something the hard way through a challenge or difficulty.
Barbell,"The barbell is an investment strategy applicable primarily to a fixed income portfolio. Following a barbell method, half the portfolio contains long-term bonds and the other half holds short-term bonds. The “barbell” gets its name because the investment strategy looks like a barbell with bonds heavily weighted at both ends of the maturity timeline. The graph will show a large number of short-term holdings and long-term maturities, but little or nothing in intermediate holdings."
Bar Chart,"Bar charts consist of multiple price bars, with each bar illustrating how the price of an asset or security moved over a specified time period. Each bar typically shows open, high, low, and closing (OHLC) prices, although this may be adjusted to show only the high, low, and close (HLC)."
Bare Trust,"A bare trust is a basic trust in which the beneficiary has the absolute right to the capital and assets within the trust, as well as the income generated from these assets."
Barrel Of Oil Equivalent (BOE),"A barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) is a term used to summarize the amount of energy that is equivalent to the amount of energy found in a barrel of crude oil. By encompassing different types of energy resources into one figure, analysts, investors, and management can assess the total amount of energy the firm can access. This is also known as crude oil equivalent (COE)."
Barrels Of Oil Equivalent Per Day (BOE/D),"Barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/D) is a term that is used often in conjunction with the production or distribution of crude oil and natural gas. Many oil companies produce both of these commodities, but the unit of measure for each is different. Oil is measured in barrels and natural gas is measured in cubic feet. To help facilitate like-for-like comparisons, the industry standardized natural gas production into ""equivalent barrels"" of oil. One barrel of oil is generally deemed to have the same amount of energy content as 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas. So this quantity of natural gas is ""equivalent"" to one barrel of oil."
Base Effect,"The base effect is the effect that choosing a different reference point for a comparison between two data points can have on the result of the comparison. This often involves the use of some kind of ratio or index value between two points in a time-series data set, but can also apply to cross-sectional or other types of data."
Base Pay,"Base pay is the initial salary paid to an employee, not including any benefits, bonuses, or raises. It is the rate of compensation an employee receives in exchange for services. An employee's base pay can be expressed as an hourly rate, or as a weekly, monthly, or annual salary."
Base Year,"A base year is the first of a series of years in an economic or financial index. It is typically set to an arbitrary level of 100. New, up-to-date base years are periodically introduced to keep data current in a particular index. Any year can serve as a base year, but analysts typically choose recent years."
Basel I,"Basel I is a set of international banking regulations put forth by the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision (BCBS) that sets out the minimum capital requirements of financial institutions with the goal of minimizing credit risk. Banks that operate internationally are required to maintain a minimum amount (8%) of capital based on a percent of risk-weighted assets. Basel I is the first of three sets of regulations known individually as Basel I, II, and III, and together as the Basel Accords."
Basel II,"Basel II is a set of international banking regulations put forth by the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision, which leveled the international regulation field with uniform rules and guidelines. Basel II expanded rules for minimum capital requirements established under Basel I, the first international regulatory accord, and provided the framework for regulatory review, as well as set disclosure requirements for assessment of capital adequacy of banks. The main difference between Basel II and Basel I is that Basel II incorporates credit risk of assets held by financial institutions to determine regulatory capital ratios."
Basel III,"Basel III is a 2009 international regulatory accord that introduced a set of reforms designed to mitigate risk within the international banking sector, by requiring banks to maintain proper leverage ratios and keep certain levels of reserve capital on hand."
Baseline,"A baseline is a fixed point of reference that is used for comparison purposes. In business, the success of a project or product is often measured against a baseline number for costs, sales, or any number of other variables. A project may exceed a baseline number or fail to meet it."
Basic Earnings Per Share (EPS),Basic earnings per share (EPS) tells investors how much of a firm's net income was allotted to each share of common stock. It is reported in a company's income statement and is especially informative for businesses with only common stock in their capital structures.
Basic Materials,"The basic materials sector is an industry category made up of businesses engaged in the discovery, development, and processing of raw materials. The sector includes companies engaged in mining and metal refining, chemical products, and forestry products."
Basis Point (BPS),"Basis points (BPS) refers to a common unit of measure for interest rates and other percentages in finance. One basis point is equal to 1/100th of 1%, or 0.01%, or 0.0001, and is used to denote the percentage change in a financial instrument. The relationship between percentage changes and basis points can be summarized as follows: 1% change = 100 basis points and 0.01% = 1 basis point. Basis points are typically expressed in the abbreviations ""bp,"" ""bps,"" or ""bips."""
Basket of Goods,"A basket of goods refers to a fixed set of consumer products and services whose price is evaluated on a regular basis, often monthly or annually. This basket is used to track inflation in a specific market or country, so that if the price of the basket of goods increases by 2% in a year, inflation can thus be said to be 2%. The goods in the basket are meant to be representative of the broader economy and are adjusted periodically to account for changes in consumer habits."
Basket Trade,"A basket trade is an order to buy or sell a group of securities simultaneously. Basket trading is essential for institutional investors and investment funds that wish to hold a large number of securities in certain proportions. As cash moves in and out of the fund, large baskets of securities must be bought or sold simultaneously, so that price movements for each security do not alter the portfolio allocation."
BAT Stocks,"BAT is an acronym referring to Baidu Inc. (BIDU), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA) and Tencent Holdings Ltd. (0700.Hong Kong, TCEHY), three large Chinese internet stocks often likened to Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) subsidiary Google, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Facebook Inc. (FB). The BATs are often compared to the FANGs—or variations—which comprise Facebook, Amazon, Netflix Inc. (NFLX) and Alphabet."
Batch Processing,"Batch processing is the processing of transactions in a group or batch. No user interaction is required once batch processing is underway. This differentiates batch processing from transaction processing, which involves processing transactions one at a time and requires user interaction."
Baye's Theorem,"Bayes' theorem, named after 18th-century British mathematician Thomas Bayes, is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probability. Conditional probability is the likelihood of an outcome occurring, based on a previous outcome occurring. Bayes' theorem provides a way to revise existing predictions or theories (update probabilities) given new or additional evidence. In finance, Bayes' theorem can be used to rate the risk of lending money to potential borrowers."
BCG Growth-Share Matrix,"The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) growth-share matrix is a planning tool that uses graphical representations of a company’s products and services in an effort to help the company decide what it should keep, sell, or invest more in."
Benefit-Cost Ratio,"A benefit-cost ratio (BCR) is a ratio used in a cost-benefit analysis to summarize the overall relationship between the relative costs and benefits of a proposed project. BCR can be expressed in monetary or qualitative terms. If a project has a BCR greater than 1.0, the project is expected to deliver a positive net present value to a firm and its investors."
Beacon (Pinnacle) Score,"The Beacon Score, which has since transitioned to the Pinnacle Score, is a credit score generated by the Equifax Credit Bureau to provide lenders with insight on an individual's creditworthiness. Beacon Scores are credit scores, which are determined through a complex algorithm. These numbers give the lender insight on a borrower’s credit history and potential ability to be able to repay the debt for which they are applying."
Bear Call Spread,"A bear call spread, or a bear call credit spread, is a type of options strategy used when an options trader expects a decline in the price of the underlying asset. A bear call spread is achieved by purchasing call options at a specific strike price while also selling the same number of calls with the same expiration date, but at a lower strike price. The maximum profit to be gained using this strategy is equal to the credit received when initiating the trade."
Bear Hug,"In business, a bear hug is an offer made by one company to buy the shares of another for a much higher per-share price than what that company is worth in the market. It's an acquisition strategy that companies sometimes use when there's doubt that the target company's management or shareholders are willing to sell."
Bear Market,A bear market is when a market experiences prolonged price declines. It typically describes a condition in which securities prices fall 20% or more from recent highs amid widespread pessimism and negative investor sentiment.
Bear Put Spread,"A bear put spread is a type of options strategy where an investor or trader expects a moderate-to-large decline in the price of a security or asset and wants to reduce the cost of holding the option trade.

This approach assumes individual companies can do well even in an industry that is not performing, at least on a relative basis."
Bounced Check,"A bounced check is slang for a check that cannot be processed because the account holder has nonsufficient funds (NSF) available for use. Banks return, or ""bounce"", these checks, also known as rubber checks, rather than honoring them, and banks charge the check writers NSF fees."

In other words, the analysis shows how many sales it takes to pay for the cost of doing business. Analyzing different price levels relating to various levels of demand, the break-even analysis determines what level of sales are necessary to cover the company's total fixed costs. A demand-side analysis would give a seller significant insight into selling capabilities."
Breakeven Point (BEP),"In accounting, the breakeven point formula is determined by dividing the total fixed costs associated with production by the revenue per individual unit minus the variable costs per unit. In this case, fixed costs refer to those which do not change depending upon the number of units sold. Put differently, the breakeven point is the production level at which total revenues for a product equal total expenses."
Breakout,"A breakout refers to when the price of an asset moves above a resistance area, or moves below a support area. Breakouts indicate the potential for the price to start trending in the breakout direction. For example, a breakout to the upside from a chart pattern could indicate the price will start trending higher. Breakouts that occur on high volume (relative to normal volume) show greater conviction which means the price is more likely to trend in that direction."

Bullet Bond,"A bullet bond is a debt instrument whose entire principal value is paid in one lump sum on the maturity date, as opposed to amortizing the bond over its lifetime. Bullet bonds cannot be redeemed early by an issuer, which means they are non-callable. Because of this, bullet bonds typically pay a relatively low rate of interest due to the issuer's high-interest rate exposure."
Bullet Repayment,"A bullet repayment is a lump sum payment made for the entirety of an outstanding loan amount, usually at maturity. It can also be a single payment of principal on a bond."
Bullish Abandoned Baby,"The bullish abandoned baby is a type of candlestick pattern that is used by traders to signal a reversal of a downtrend.

A commercial bank is where most people do their banking."
Commercial Loan,"A commercial loan is a debt-based funding arrangement between a business and a financial institution such as a bank. It is typically used to fund major capital expenditures and/or cover operational costs that the company may otherwise be unable to afford. Expensive upfront costs and regulatory hurdles often prevent small businesses from having direct access to bond and equity markets for financing. This means that, not unlike individual consumers, smaller businesses must rely on other lending products, such as lines of credit, unsecured loans or term loans."
Commercial Mortgage-Backed Security (CMBS),Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) are fixed-income investment products that are backed by mortgages on commercial properties rather than residential real estate. CMBS can provide liquidity to real estate investors and commercial lenders alike.

However, if the companies use different accounting methods, any comparison may not be accurate."
Common Size Income Statement,"A common size income statement is an income statement in which each line item is expressed as a percentage of the value of revenue or sales. It is used for vertical analysis, in which each line item in a financial statement is represented as a percentage of a base figure within the statement."
Common Stock,"Common stock is a security that represents ownership in a corporation. Holders of common stock elect the board of directors and vote on corporate policies. This form of equity ownership typically yields higher rates of return long term. However, in the event of liquidation, common shareholders have rights to a company's assets only after bondholders, preferred shareholders, and other debtholders are paid in full. Common stock is reported in the stockholder's equity section of a company's balance sheet."
Community Reinvestment Act (CRA),"The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) is a federal law enacted in 1977 to encourage depository institutions to meet the credit needs of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.

Analysts compile a list of available statistics for the companies being reviewed and calculate the valuation multiples in order to compare them."
Comparative Advantage,Comparative advantage is an economy's ability to produce a particular good or service at a lower opportunity cost than its trading partners. A comparative advantage gives a company the ability to sell goods and services at a lower price than its competitors and realize stronger sales margins.
Comparative Market Analysis,"A comparative market analysis (CMA) is an estimate of a home's value based on recently sold, similar properties in the immediate area. Real estate agents and brokers create CMA reports to help sellers set listing prices for their homes and, less commonly, to help buyers make competitive offers. Individuals can perform their own comparative market analysis by researching comparable properties (known as ""comps"") on real estate listing sites, such as realtor.com."
Compensatory Damages,"Compensatory damages are money awarded to a plaintiff to compensate for damages, injury, or another incurred loss. Compensatory damages are awarded in civil court cases where loss has occurred as a result of the negligence or unlawful conduct of another party."
Competitive Intelligence,"Competitive intelligence, sometimes referred to as corporate intelligence, refers to the ability to gather, analyze, and use information collected on competitors, customers, and other market factors that contribute to a business's competitive advantage. Competitive intelligence is important because it helps businesses understand their competitive environment and the opportunities and challenges it presents. Businesses analyze the information to create effective and efficient business practices."

Compound Interest,"Compound interest (or compounding interest) is the interest on a loan or deposit calculated based on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. Thought to have originated in 17th-century Italy, compound interest can be thought of as ""interest on interest,"" and will make a sum grow at a faster rate than simple interest, which is calculated only on the principal amount."
Compounding,"Compounding is the process in which an asset's earnings, from either capital gains or interest, are reinvested to generate additional earnings over time. This growth, calculated using exponential functions, occurs because the investment will generate earnings from both its initial principal and the accumulated earnings from preceding periods. Compounding, therefore, differs from linear growth, where only the principal earns interest each period."
Comprehensive Income,"Comprehensive income is the variation in a company's net assets from non-owner sources during a specific period. Comprehensive income includes net income and unrealized income, such as unrealized gains or losses on hedge/derivative financial instruments and foreign currency transaction gains or losses. Comprehensive income provides a holistic view of a company's income not fully captured on the income statement."
Comps,"The term comps, short for comparables, carries different meanings depending on the industry and context, but generally entails a comparison of financial metrics and other factors to quantify performance or determine valuation."
Conditional Probability,"Conditional probability is defined as the likelihood of an event or outcome occurring, based on the occurrence of a previous event or outcome. Conditional probability is calculated by multiplying the probability of the preceding event by the updated probability of the succeeding, or conditional, event."
Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR),"Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), also known as the expected shortfall, is a risk assessment measure that quantifies the amount of tail risk an investment portfolio has. CVaR is derived by taking a weighted average of the “extreme” losses in the tail of the distribution of possible returns, beyond the value at risk (VaR) cutoff point. Conditional value at risk is used in portfolio optimization for effective risk management."
Confidence Interval,"A confidence interval, in statistics, refers to the probability that a population parameter will fall between a set of values for a certain proportion of times."
Conflict of Interest,"A conflict of interest occurs when an entity or individual becomes unreliable because of a clash between personal (or self-serving) interests and professional duties or responsibilities. Such a conflict occurs when a company or person has a vested interest—such as money, status, knowledge, relationships, or reputation—which puts into question whether their actions, judgment, and/or decision-making can be unbiased. When such a situation arises, the party is usually asked to remove themselves, and it is often legally required of them."
Conflict Theory,"Conflict theory, first purported by Karl Marx, is a theory that society is in a state of perpetual conflict because of competition for limited resources. Conflict theory holds that social order is maintained by domination and power, rather than by consensus and conformity. According to conflict theory, those with wealth and power try to hold on to it by any means possible, chiefly by suppressing the poor and powerless. A basic premise of conflict theory is that individuals and groups within society will work to try to maximize their own wealth and power.﻿﻿"

A consolidation pattern could be broken for several reasons, such as the release of materially important news or the triggering of a succession of limit orders."
Construction Loan,"A construction loan (also known as a “self-build loan"") is a short-term loan used to finance the building of a home or another real estate project. The builder or home buyer takes out a construction loan to cover the costs of the project before obtaining long-term funding. Because they are considered relatively risky, construction loans usually have higher interest rates than traditional mortgage loans."
Consumer Credit,Consumer credit is personal debt taken on to purchase goods and services. A credit card is one form of consumer credit.
Consumer Discretionary,"Consumer discretionary is a term for classifying goods and services that are considered non-essential by consumers, but desirable if their available income is sufficient to purchase them.

Alternatively called final goods, consumer goods are the end result of production and manufacturing and are what a consumer will see stocked on the store shelf. Clothing, food, and jewelry are all examples of consumer goods. Basic or raw materials, such as copper, are not considered consumer goods because they must be transformed into usable products."
Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG),"Consumer packaged goods (CPG) are items used daily by average consumers that require routine replacement or replenishment, such as food, beverages, clothes, tobacco, makeup, and household products."
Consumer Surplus,Consumer surplus is an economic measurement of consumer benefits.

Consumerism,"Consumerism is the idea that increasing the consumption of goods and services purchased in the market is always a desirable goal and that a person's wellbeing and happiness depend fundamentally on obtaining consumer goods and material possessions. In an economic sense, it is related to the predominantly Keynesian idea that consumer spending is the key driver of the economy and that encouraging consumers to spend is a major policy goal. From this point of view, consumerism is a positive phenomenon that fuels economic growth."
Consumption Function,"The consumption function, or Keynesian consumption function, is an economic formula that represents the functional relationship between total consumption and gross national income. It was introduced by British economist John Maynard Keynes, who argued the function could be used to track and predict total aggregate consumption expenditures."
Contingency,"A contingency is a potential occurrence of a negative event in the future, such as an economic recession, natural disaster, fraudulent activity, terrorist attack, or a pandemic. In 2020, businesses were hit with the coronavirus pandemic forcing many employees to have to work remotely. As a result, companies needed to implement a remote work strategy. However, for some businesses, working remotely wasn't an option, which led to the implementation of enhanced safety measures for employees and customers to prevent the spread of the virus."
Contingent Asset,"A contingent asset is a potential economic benefit that is dependent on future events out of a company’s control. Not knowing for certain whether these gains will materialize, or being able to determine their precise economic value, means these assets cannot be recorded on the balance sheet. However, they can be reported in the accompanying notes of financial statements, provided that certain conditions are met. A contingent asset is also known as a potential asset."
Contingent Beneficiary,"A contingent beneficiary is specified by an insurance contract holder or retirement account owner as the person or entity receiving proceeds if the primary beneficiary is deceased, unable to be located, or refuses the inheritance at the time the proceeds are to be paid. A contingent beneficiary is entitled to insurance proceeds or retirement assets only if certain predetermined conditions are met at the time of the insured's death, such as information found in a will."
Contingent Convertible,"Contingent convertibles (CoCos) are a debt instrument issued by European financial institutions. Contingent convertibles work in a fashion similar to traditional convertible bonds. They have a specific strike price that once breached, can convert the bond into equity or stock. The primary investors for CoCos are individual investors in Europe and Asia and private banks."
Contingent Liability,A contingent liability is a liability that may occur depending on the outcome of an uncertain future event. A contingent liability is recorded if the contingency is likely and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. The liability may be disclosed in a footnote on the financial statements unless both conditions are not met.
Contingent Value Rights (CVR),"The term contingent value right (CVR) refers to a right often granted to shareholders of a company facing restructuring or a buyout. These rights ensure that the shareholders get certain benefits if a specific event occurs, usually within a specified time frame. These rights are similar to options because they frequently have an expiration date, beyond which the rights to the additional benefits will not apply. CVRs are usually related to the performance of a company's stock."
Contra Account,"A contra account is used in a general ledger to reduce the value of a related account when the two are netted together. A contra account's natural balance is the opposite of the associated account. If a debit is the natural balance recorded in the related account, the contra account records a credit. For example, the contra account for a fixed asset is accumulated depreciation."
Contract For Differences (CFD),A contract for differences (CFD) is an arrangement made in financial derivatives trading where the differences in the settlement between the open and closing trade prices are cash-settled. There is no delivery of physical goods or securities with CFDs.

Contrarian,"Contrarian investing is an investment style in which investors purposefully go against prevailing market trends by selling when others are buying, and buying when most investors are selling."
Contributed Capital,"Contributed capital, also known as paid-in capital, is the cash and other assets that shareholders have given a company in exchange for stock. Investors make capital contributions when a company issues equity shares based on a price that shareholders are willing to pay for them. The total amount of contributed capital or paid-in-capital represents their stake or ownership in the company."

Controller,"A controller is an individual who has responsibility for all accounting-related activities, including high-level accounting, managerial accounting, and finance activities, within a company. A financial controller typically reports to a firm's chief financial officer (CFO), although these two positions may be combined in smaller businesses. The duties of a controller include assisting with the preparation of the operating budgets, overseeing financial reporting and performing essential duties relating to payroll."
Conventional Mortgage,"A conventional mortgage or conventional loan is any type of home buyer’s loan that is not offered or secured by a government entity.

Cost and Freight (CFR),"Cost and freight (CFR) is a legal term used in foreign trade contracts. In a contract specifying that a sale is cost and freight, the seller is required to arrange for the carriage of goods by sea to a port of destination and provide the buyer with the documents necessary to obtain them from the carrier. With a cost and freight sale, the seller is not responsible for procuring marine insurance against the risk of loss or damage to the cargo during transit. Cost and freight is a term used strictly for cargo transported by sea or inland waterways."
Cost Basis,"Cost basis is the original value of an asset for tax purposes, usually the purchase price, adjusted for stock splits, dividends, and return of capital distributions. This value is used to determine the capital gain, which is equal to the difference between the asset's cost basis and the current market value. The term can also be used to describe the difference between the cash price and the futures price of a given commodity."
Cost-Benefit Analysis,"A cost-benefit analysis is a systematic process that businesses use to analyze which decisions to make and which to forgo. The cost benefit analyst sums the potential rewards expected from a situation or action and then subtracts the total costs associated with taking that action. Some consultants or analysts also build models to assign a dollar value on intangible items, such as the benefits and costs associated with living in a certain town."
Cost of Capital,"Cost of capital is the required return necessary to make a capital budgeting project, such as building a new factory, worthwhile. When analysts and investors discuss the cost of capital, they typically mean the weighted average of a firm's cost of debt and cost of equity blended together."
Cost Control,"Cost control is the practice of identifying and reducing business expenses to increase profits, and it starts with the budgeting process. A business owner compares the company's actual financial results with the budgeted expectations, and if actual costs are higher than planned, management has the information it needs to take action."
Cost of Debt,"The cost of debt is the effective interest rate a company pays on its debts. It’s the cost of debt, such as bonds and loans, among others. The cost of debt often refers to the before-tax cost of debt, which is the company's cost of debt before taking taxes into account. However, the difference in the cost of debt before and after taxes lies in the fact that interest expenses are deductible."
Cost of Equity,The cost of equity is the return a company requires to decide if an investment meets capital return requirements. Firms often use it as a capital budgeting threshold for the required rate of return. A firm's cost of equity represents the compensation the market demands in exchange for owning the asset and bearing the risk of ownership. The traditional formula for the cost of equity is the dividend capitalization model and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).
Cost of Goods Sold (COGS),"Cost of goods sold (COGS) refers to the direct costs of producing the goods sold by a company. This amount includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the good. It excludes indirect expenses, such as distribution costs and sales force costs."
"Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF)","Cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) is an expense paid by a seller to cover the costs, insurance, and freight of a buyer's order while it is in transit. The goods are exported to a port named in the sales contract. Until the goods are fully loaded onto a transport ship, the seller bears the costs of any loss or damage to the product. Further, if the product requires additional customs duties, export paperwork, or inspections or rerouting, the seller must cover these expenses. Once the freight loads, the buyer becomes responsible for all other costs. CIF is similar but not the same as carriage and insurance paid to (CIP)."
Cost of Labor,"The cost of labor is the sum of all wages paid to employees, as well as the cost of employee benefits and payroll taxes paid by an employer. The cost of labor is broken into direct and indirect (overhead) costs. Direct costs include wages for the employees that produce a product, including workers on an assembly line, while indirect costs are associated with support labor, such as employees who maintain factory equipment."
Cost of Living,"The cost of living is the amount of money needed to cover basic expenses such as housing, food, taxes, and healthcare in a certain place and time period. The cost of living is often used to compare how expensive it is to live in one city versus another. The cost of living is tied to wages. If expenses are higher in a city, such as New York, for example, salary levels must be higher so that people can afford to live in that city."
Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA),"A cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) is an increase made to Social Security and Supplemental Security Income to counteract the effects of inflation. Cost-of-living adjustments are typically equal to the percentage increase in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W) for a specific period.﻿﻿ So if someone received $10,000 in Social Security benefits last year and the COLA for this year is 4.1%, their benefits for this year would be $10,410. The COLA for 2021 is 1.3%, so that payment would rise to $10,130."
Cost of Revenue,The term cost of revenue refers to the total cost of manufacturing and delivering a product or service to consumers. Cost of revenue information is found in a company's income statement. It is designed to represent the direct costs associated with the goods and services the company provides. The service industry often favors using the cost of revenue metric because it is a more comprehensive account of the various costs associated with selling a good or service.
Cost Per Click (CPC),Cost per click (CPC) is an online advertising revenue model that websites use to bill advertisers based on the number of times visitors click on a display ad attached to their sites.
Cost Per Thousand (CPM),"Cost per thousand (CPM), also called cost per mille, is a marketing term used to denote the price of 1,000 advertisement impressions on one web page. If a website publisher charges $2.00 CPM, that means an advertiser must pay $2.00 for every 1,000 impressions of its ad. The ""M"" in CPM represents the word ""mille,"" which is Latin for ""thousands."""
Cost-Plus Contract,"A cost-plus contract is an agreement to reimburse a company for expenses incurred plus a specific amount of profit, usually stated as a percentage of the contract’s full price. These type of contracts are primarily used in construction where the buyer assumes some of the risk but also provides a degree of flexibility to the contractor. In such a case, the party drawing up the contract anticipates that the contractor will make good on his or her promises to deliver, and agrees to pay extra so that the contractor can make additional profit upon completion."
Cost-Push,"Cost-push inflation occurs when overall prices increase (inflation) due to increases in the cost of wages and raw materials. Higher costs of production can decrease the aggregate supply (the amount of total production) in the economy. Since the demand for goods hasn't changed, the price increases from production are passed onto consumers creating cost-push inflation."
Cost-Volume-Profit (CVP),Cost-volume-profit (CVP) analysis is a method of cost accounting that looks at the impact that varying levels of costs and volume have on operating profit.
Cottage Industry,"A cottage industry is a small-scale, decentralized manufacturing business often operated out of a home rather than a purpose-built facility. Cottage industries are defined by the amount of investment required to start, as well as the number of people employed. They often focus on the production of labor-intensive goods but face a significant disadvantage when competing with factory-based manufacturers that mass-produce goods."
Counteroffer,"A counteroffer is a response given to an initial offer. A counteroffer means the original offer was rejected and replaced with another one. The counteroffer gives the original offerer three options: accept the counteroffer, reject it, or make another offer."
Counterparty Risk,"Counterparty risk is the likelihood or probability that one of those involved in a transaction might default on its contractual obligation. Counterparty risk can exist in credit, investment, and trading transactions."
Countertrade,"Countertrade is a reciprocal form of international trade in which goods or services are exchanged for other goods or services rather than for hard currency. This type of international trade is more common in developing countries with limited foreign exchange or credit facilities. Countertrade can be classified into three broad categories: barter, counterpurchase, and offset."
Coupon Rate,A coupon rate is the nominal yield paid by a fixed-income security. It is the annual coupon payments paid by the issuer relative to the bond's face or par value.
Covenant,"In legal and financial terminology, a covenant is a promise in an indenture, or any other formal debt agreement, that certain activities will or will not be carried out or that certain thresholds will be met. Covenants in finance most often relate to terms in a financial contract, such as a loan document or bond issue stating the limits at which the borrower can further lend."
Cover Letter,"A cover letter is a written document commonly submitted with a job application outlining the applicant's credentials and interest in the open position. Since a cover letter is often one of only two documents sent to a potential employer, a well- or poorly-written letter can impact whether the applicant is called for an interview."
Coverage Ratio,"A coverage ratio, broadly, is a metric intended to measure a company's ability to service its debt and meet its financial obligations, such as interest payments or dividends. The higher the coverage ratio, the easier it should be to make interest payments on its debt or pay dividends. The trend of coverage ratios over time is also studied by analysts and investors to ascertain the change in a company's financial position."
Covered Interest Rate Parity,"Covered interest rate parity refers to a theoretical condition in which the relationship between interest rates and the spot and forward currency values of two countries are in equilibrium. The covered interest rate parity situation means there is no opportunity for arbitrage using forward contracts, which often exists between countries with different interest rates."
Creative Destruction,Creative destruction is the dismantling of long-standing practices in order to make way for innovation and is seen as a driving force of capitalism.
Credit Analyst,"A credit analyst is a financial professional who assesses the creditworthiness of securities, individuals, or companies. Credit analysts determine the likelihood that a borrower can repay their financial obligations by reviewing the borrower's financial and credit history and determining whether the state of the subject's financial health and the economic conditions are favorable to repayment."
Credit Bureau,"A credit bureau, also known in the U.S. as a credit reporting company or credit reporting agency, is an organization that collects and researches individual credit information and sells it to creditors for a fee, so they can make decisions about granting loans."
Credit Card,"A credit card is a thin rectangular piece of plastic or metal issued by a bank or financial services company, that allows cardholders to borrow funds with which to pay for goods and services with merchants that accept cards for payment. Credit cards impose the condition that cardholders pay back the borrowed money, plus any applicable interest, as well as any additional agreed-upon charges, either in full by the billing date or over time. An example of a credit card is the Chase Sapphire Reserve. (You can read our Chase Sapphire Reserve credit card review to get a good sense of all the various attributes of a credit card)."
Credit Card Balance,A credit card balance is the total amount of money that you owe to your credit card company. The balance changes based on when and how the card is used.
Credit Card Dump,"A credit card dump is a type of crime in which the criminal makes an unauthorized digital copy of a credit card. This type of crime has existed for decades, but it has seen wider public awareness in recent years due to the rising prevalence of credit card forgeries, identity theft, and other types of cybercrime."
Credit Default Swap (CDS),"A credit default swap (CDS) is a financial derivative or contract that allows an investor to ""swap"" or offset his or her credit risk with that of another investor. For example, if a lender is worried that a borrower is going to default on a loan, the lender could use a CDS to offset or swap that risk."
Credit Facility,"A credit facility is a type of loan made in a business or corporate finance context. It allows the borrowing business to take out money over an extended period of time rather than reapplying for a loan each time it needs money. In effect, a credit facility lets a company take out an umbrella loan for generating capital over an extended period of time."
Credit Limit,The term credit limit refers to the maximum amount of credit a financial institution extends to a client. A lending institution extends a credit limit on a credit card or a line of credit. Lenders usually set credit limits based on the information given by the credit-seeking applicant. A credit limit is a factor that affects consumers' credit scores and can impact their ability to obtain credit in the future.
Credit Linked Note (CLN),"A credit-linked note (CLN) is a security with an embedded credit default swap permitting the issuer to shift specific credit risk to credit investors. Credit-linked notes are created through a special purpose vehicle (SPV), or trust, which is collateralized with AAA-rated securities. Investors buy credit-linked notes from a trust that pays a fixed or floating coupon during the life of the note. In return for accepting exposure to specified credit risks, investors who buy credit-linked notes typically earn a higher rate of return compared to other bonds."
Credit Report,"A credit report is a detailed breakdown of an individual's credit history prepared by a credit bureau. Credit bureaus collect financial information about individuals and create credit reports based on that information, and lenders use the reports along with other details to determine loan applicants' creditworthiness."
Credit Score,"A credit score is a number between 300–850 that depicts a consumer's creditworthiness. The higher the score, the better a borrower looks to potential lenders. A credit score is based on credit history: number of open accounts, total levels of debt, and repayment history, and other factors. Lenders use credit scores to evaluate the probability that an individual will repay loans in a timely manner.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿"
Credit Spread,"A credit spread is the difference in yield between a U.S. Treasury bond and another debt security of the same maturity but different credit quality. Credit spreads between U.S. Treasuries and other bond issuances are measured in basis points, with a 1% difference in yield equal to a spread of 100 basis points. As an example, a 10-year Treasury note with a yield of 5% and a 10-year corporate bond with a yield of 7% are said to have a credit spread of 200 basis points. Credit spreads are also referred to as ""bond spreads"" or ""default spreads."" Credit spread allows a comparison between a corporate bond and a risk-free alternative."
Credit Union,"A credit union is a type of financial cooperative that provides traditional banking services. Ranging in size from small, volunteer-only operations to large entities with thousands of participants spanning the country, credit unions can be formed by large corporations, organizations, and other entities for their employees and members."
Creditor,"A creditor is an entity (person or institution) that extends credit by giving another entity permission to borrow money intended to be repaid in the future. A business that provides supplies or services to a company or individual and does not demand payment immediately is also considered a creditor, based on the fact that the client owes the business money for services already rendered."
Creditworthiness,"Creditworthiness is how a lender determines that you will default on your debt obligations, or how worthy you are to receive new credit. Your creditworthiness is what creditors look at before they approve any new credit to you."
Cross Culture,"Cross culture in the business world refers to a company's efforts to ensure that its people interact effectively with professionals from backgrounds different from their own. Like the adjective cross-cultural, it implies a recognition of national, regional, and ethnic differences in manners and methods and a desire to bridge them."
Cross Elasticity of Demand,"The cross elasticity of demand is an economic concept that measures the responsiveness in the quantity demanded of one good when the price for another good changes. Also called cross-price elasticity of demand, this measurement is calculated by taking the percentage change in the quantity demanded of one good and dividing it by the percentage change in the price of the other good."
Cross-Sell,"To cross-sell is to sell related or complementary products to a customer. Cross-selling is one of the most effective methods of marketing. In the financial services industry, examples of cross-selling include selling different types of investments or products to investors or tax preparation services to retirement planning clients. For instance, if a bank client has a mortgage, its sales team may try to cross-sell that client a personal line of credit or a savings product like a CD."
Crowdfunding,"Crowdfunding is the use of small amounts of capital from a large number of individuals to finance a new business venture. Crowdfunding makes use of the easy accessibility of vast networks of people through social media and crowdfunding websites to bring investors and entrepreneurs together, with the potential to increase entrepreneurship by expanding the pool of investors beyond the traditional circle of owners, relatives, and venture capitalists."
Crowding Out Effect,The crowding out effect is an economic theory arguing that rising public sector spending drives down or even eliminates private sector spending.
Crude Oil,"Crude oil is a naturally occurring petroleum product composed of hydrocarbon deposits and other organic materials. A type of fossil fuel, crude oil is refined to produce usable products including gasoline, diesel, and various other forms of petrochemicals. It is a nonrenewable resource, which means that it can't be replaced naturally at the rate we consume it and is, therefore, a limited resource."
Crypto Token,"The term crypto token refers to a special virtual currency token or how cryptocurrencies are denominated. These tokens represent fungible and tradable assets or utilities that reside on their own blockchains. Crypto tokens are often used to fundraise for crowd sales, but they can also be used as a substitute for other things. These tokens are usually created, distributed, sold, and circulated through the standard initial coin offering (ICO) process, which involves a crowdfunding exercise to fund project development."
Cryptocurrency,"A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation."
Cum Dividend,"A stock is cum dividend, which means ""with dividend,"" when a company has declared that there will be a dividend in the future but has not yet paid it out. A stock will trade cum dividend until the ex-dividend date. After that, the stock trades without its dividend rights. When the buyer receives the next dividend scheduled for distribution, the share is cum dividend."
Cum Laude,"Cum laude is Latin for ""with praise"" or ""with honor"" and represents an academic level of achievement. Educational institutions use the phrase to signify an academic degree that was awarded with honor."
Cup and Handle,"A cup and handle price pattern on a security's price chart is a technical indicator that resembles a cup with a handle, where the cup is in the shape of a ""u"" and the handle has a slight downward drift. The cup and handle is considered a bullish signal, with the right-hand side of the pattern typically experiencing lower trading volume. The pattern's formation may be as short as seven weeks or as long as 65 weeks."
Currency Carry Trade,"A currency carry trade is a strategy whereby a high-yielding currency funds the trade with a low-yielding currency. A trader using this strategy attempts to capture the difference between the rates, which can often be substantial, depending on the amount of leverage used."
Currency Exchange,"A currency exchange is a licensed business that allows customers to exchange one currency for another. Currency exchange of physical money (coins and paper bills) is usually done over a counter at a teller station, which can be found in various places such as airports, banks, hotels, and resorts. Currency exchanges make money by charging a nominal fee and through the bid-ask spread in a currency."
Currency Peg,"A currency peg is a policy in which a national government sets a specific fixed exchange rate for its currency with a foreign currency or a basket of currencies. Pegging a currency stabilizes the exchange rate between countries. Doing so provides long-term predictability of exchange rates for business planning. However, a currency peg can be challenging to maintain and distort markets if it is too far removed from the natural market price."
Current Account,"The current account records a nation's transactions with the rest of the world—specifically its net trade in goods and services, its net earnings on cross-border investments, and its net transfer payments—over a defined period of time, such as a year or a quarter. According to Trading Economics, the quarter two 2019 current account of the United States was $-128.2 billion.﻿﻿"
Current Account Deficit,"The current account deficit is a measurement of a country’s trade where the value of the goods and services it imports exceeds the value of the products it exports. The current account includes net income, such as interest and dividends, and transfers, such as foreign aid, although these components make up only a small percentage of the total current account. The current account represents a country’s foreign transactions and, like the capital account, is a component of a country’s balance of payments (BOP)."
Current Assets,"Current assets represent all the assets of a company that are expected to be conveniently sold, consumed, used, or exhausted through standard business operations with one year. Current assets appear on a company's balance sheet, one of the required financial statements that must be completed each year."
Current Liabilities,"Current liabilities are a company's short-term financial obligations that are due within one year or within a normal operating cycle. An operating cycle, also referred to as the cash conversion cycle, is the time it takes a company to purchase inventory and convert it to cash from sales. An example of a current liability is money owed to suppliers in the form of accounts payable."
Current Ratio,The current ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations or those due within one year. It tells investors and analysts how a company can maximize the current assets on its balance sheet to satisfy its current debt and other payables.
Current Yield,"Current yield is an investment's annual income (interest or dividends) divided by the current price of the security. This measure examines the current price of a bond, rather than looking at its face value. Current yield represents the return an investor would expect to earn, if the owner purchased the bond and held it for a year. However, current yield is not the actual return an investor receives if he holds a bond until maturity."
CUSIP Number,"CUSIP refers to the Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures which oversees the entire CUSIP system. The CUSIP number is a unique identification number assigned to all stocks and registered bonds in the United States and Canada, and it is used to create a concrete distinction between securities that are traded on public markets. These numbers are used to help facilitate trades and settlements by providing a constant identifier to help distinguish the securities within a trade. Each trade and the corresponding CUSIP number are recorded to facilitate the tracking of actions and activities."
Custodial Account,"The term custodial account generally refers to a savings account at a financial institution, mutual fund company, or brokerage firm that an adult controls for a minor (a person under the age of 18 or 21 years, depending on the laws of the state of residence). Approval from the custodian is mandatory for the account to conduct transactions, such as buying or selling securities."
Custodian,A custodian or custodian bank is a financial institution that holds customers' securities for safekeeping to prevent them from being stolen or lost. The custodian may hold stocks or other assets in electronic or physical form.
Customer,"A customer is an individual or business that purchases another company's goods or services. Customers are important because they drive revenues; without them, businesses cannot continue to exist. All businesses compete with other companies to attract customers, either by aggressively advertising their products, by lowering prices to expand their customer bases or developing unique products and experiences that customers love, think Apple, Tesla, Google or TikTok."
Customer Relationship Management (CRM),"Customer relationship management (CRM) refers to the principles, practices, and guidelines that an organization follows when interacting with its customers. From the organization's point of view, this entire relationship encompasses direct interactions with customers, such as sales and service-related processes, forecasting, and the analysis of customer trends and behaviors. Ultimately, CRM serves to enhance the customer's overall experience."
Customer Service,Customer service is the direct one-on-one interaction between a consumer making a purchase and a representative of the company that is selling it. Most retailers see this direct interaction as a critical factor in ensuring buyer satisfaction and encouraging repeat business.
Customer to Customer (C2C),"Customer to customer (C2C) is a business model whereby customers can trade with each other, typically in an online environment. Two implementations of C2C markets are auctions and classified advertisements. C2C marketing has soared in popularity with the arrival of the Internet and companies such as eBay, Etsy, and Craigslist."
Cyclical Industry,"A cyclical industry is a type of industry that is sensitive to the business cycle, such that revenues generally are higher in periods of economic prosperity and expansion and are lower in periods of economic downturn and contraction. Companies in cyclical industries can deal with this type of volatility by implementing employee layoffs and cuts to compensate during bad times and paying bonuses and hiring en masse in good times."
Cyclical Stocks,"A cyclical stock is a stock that's price is affected by macroeconomic or systematic changes in the overall economy. Cyclical stocks are known for following the cycles of an economy through expansion, peak, recession, and recovery. Most cyclical stocks involve companies that sell consumer discretionary items that consumers buy more during a booming economy but spend less on during a recession."
Cyclical Unemployment,Cyclical unemployment is the component of overall unemployment that results directly from cycles of economic upturn and downturn. Unemployment typically rises during recessions and declines during economic expansions. Moderating cyclical unemployment during recessions is a major motivation behind the study of economics and the goal of the various policy tools that governments employ to stimulate the economy.
DAGMAR,DAGMAR (defining advertising goals for measured advertising results) is a marketing model used to establish clear objectives for an advertising campaign and measure its success. The DAGMAR model was introduced by Russell Colley in a 1961 report to the Association of National Advertisers and was expanded upon in 1995 by Solomon Dutka.
Dark Cloud Cover,"Dark Cloud Cover is a bearish reversal candlestick pattern where a down candle (typically black or red) opens above the close of the prior up candle (typically white or green), and then closes below the midpoint of the up candle."
Dark Pool,A dark pool is a privately organized financial forum or exchange for trading securities. Dark pools allow institutional investors to trade without exposure until after the trade has been executed and reported. Dark pools are a type of alternative trading system (ATS) that give certain investors the opportunity to place large orders and make trades without publicly revealing their intentions during the search for a buyer or seller.
Dark Web,"The dark web refers to encrypted online content that is not indexed by conventional search engines. Sometimes, the dark web is also called the dark net. The dark web is a part of the deep web, which just refers to websites that do not appear on search engines. Most deep web content consists of private files hosted on Dropbox and its competitors or subscriber-only databases rather than anything illegal."
Darvas Box Theory,Darvas box theory is a trading strategy developed by Nicolas Darvas that targets stocks using highs and volume as key indicators.
Data Analytics,Data analytics is the science of analyzing raw data in order to make conclusions about that information. Many of the techniques and processes of data analytics have been automated into mechanical processes and algorithms that work over raw data for human consumption.
Data Mining,"Data mining is a process used by companies to turn raw data into useful information. By using software to look for patterns in large batches of data, businesses can learn more about their customers to develop more effective marketing strategies, increase sales and decrease costs. Data mining depends on effective data collection, warehousing, and computer processing."
Data Smoothing,Data smoothing is done by using an algorithm to remove noise from a data set. This allows important patterns to more clearly stand out.
Data Warehousing,Data warehousing is the secure electronic storage of information by a business or other organization. The goal of data warehousing is to create a trove of historical data that can be retrieved and analyzed to provide useful insight into the organization's operations.
Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number,"A data universal numbering system or DUNS number is a unique, nine-digit series of numerals that identifies a business. Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) creates the number, which generates a business profile in its database and provides a company's name, phone number, address, number of workers and line of business, along with other relevant corporate information."
David Ricardo,"David Ricardo (1772–1823) was a classical economist best known for his theory on wages and profit, the labor theory of value, the theory of comparative advantage, and the theory of rents. David Ricardo and several other economists also simultaneously and independently discovered the law of diminishing marginal returns. His most well-known work is Principles of Political Economy and Taxation (1817)."
David Tepper,"David Tepper is a legendary investor who specializes in distressed debt and manages one of the most successful hedge fund firms of all time. David Tepper’s worth is approximately $13 billion, according to Forbes 2020 The World’s Billionaires List.﻿﻿"
DAX Stock Index,"The DAX—also known as the Deutscher Aktien Index—is a stock index that represents 30 of the largest and most liquid German companies that trade on the Frankfurt Exchange. The prices used to calculate the DAX Index come through Xetra, an electronic trading system. A free-float methodology is used to calculate the index weightings along with a measure of the average trading volume."
Day-Count Convention,"A day-count convention is the system used on debt securities, such as bonds or swaps, to calculate the amount of accrued interest or the present value when the next coupon payment is less than a full coupon period away."
Day Order,"A day order is a stipulation placed on an order to a broker to execute a trade at a specific price that expires at the end of the trading day if it is not completed. A day order can be a limit order to buy or sell a security, but its duration is limited to the remainder of that trading day."
Day Trader,"A day trader is a type of trader who executes a relatively large volume of short and long trades to capitalize on intraday market price action. The goal is to profit from very short-term price movements. Day traders can also use leverage to amplify returns, which can also amplify losses."
Days Payable Outstanding,"Days payable outstanding (DPO) is a financial ratio that indicates the average time (in days) that a company takes to pay its bills and invoices to its trade creditors, which may include suppliers, vendors, or financiers. The ratio is typically calculated on a quarterly or annual basis, and indicates how well the company’s cash outflows are being managed."
Days Sales of Inventory (DSI),"The days sales of inventory (DSI) is a financial ratio that indicates the average time in days that a company takes to turn its inventory, including goods that are a work in progress, into sales."
Days Sales Outstanding,"Days sales outstanding (DSO) is a measure of the average number of days that it takes a company to collect payment for a sale. DSO is often determined on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis."
Days Working Capital,"Days working capital describes how many days it takes for a company to convert its working capital into revenue. The more days a company has of working capital, the more time it takes to convert that working capital into sales. The higher the days working capital number the less efficient a company is."
What Is the De Minimis Tax Rule?,"The de minimis tax rule sets the threshold at which a discount bond should be taxed as a capital gain rather than as ordinary income. The rule states that a discount that is less than a quarter-point per full year between its time of acquisition and its maturity is too small to be considered a market discount for tax purposes. Instead, the accretion from the purchase price to the par value should be treated as a capital gain, if it is held for more than one year."
Dead Cat Bounce,"A dead cat bounce is a temporary, short-lived recovery of asset prices from a prolonged decline or a bear market that is followed by the continuation of the downtrend. Frequently, downtrends are interrupted by brief periods of recovery—or small rallies—during which prices temporarily rise."
What Is Deadweight Loss Of Taxation?,"The term deadweight loss of taxation refers to the measurement of loss caused by the imposition of a new tax. This results from a new tax that is more than what is normally paid to the government's taxing authority. This theory suggests that imposing a new tax or raising an old one can backfire, resulting in insufficient or no gains in government revenues due to the decline in demand for the goods or services being taxed. A deadweight loss, therefore, disrupts the balance between supply and demand. English economist Alfred Marshall is widely credited as the originator of deadweight loss analysis."
Deadweight Loss,"A deadweight loss is a cost to society created by market inefficiency, which occurs when supply and demand are out of equilibrium. Mainly used in economics, deadweight loss can be applied to any deficiency caused by an inefficient allocation of resources."
Dealer,"Dealers are people or firms who buy and sell securities for their own account, whether through a broker or otherwise. A dealer acts as a principal in trading for its own account, as opposed to a broker who acts as an agent who executes orders on behalf of its clients."
Dealer Market,"A dealer market is a financial market mechanism wherein multiple dealers post prices at which they will buy or sell a specific security or instrument. In a dealer market, a dealer – who is designated as a “market maker” – provides liquidity and transparency by electronically displaying the prices at which it is willing to make a market in a security, indicating both the price at which it will buy the security (the “bid” price) and the price at which it will sell the security (the “offer” price). Bonds and foreign exchanges trade primarily in dealer markets, while stock trading on the Nasdaq is a prime example of an equity dealer market."
Death Benefit,"A death benefit is a payout to the beneficiary of a life insurance policy, annuity, or pension when the insured or annuitant dies. For life insurance policies, death benefits are not subject to income tax and named beneficiaries ordinarily receive the death benefit as a lump-sum payment."
Death Cross,"The death cross is a technical chart pattern indicating the potential for a major sell-off. The death cross appears on a chart when a stock’s short-term moving average crosses below its long-term moving average. Typically, the most common moving averages used in this pattern are the 50-day and 200-day moving averages."
Death Taxes,Death taxes are taxes imposed by the federal and/or state government on someone's estate upon their death. These taxes are levied on the beneficiary who receives the property in the deceased's will or the estate which pays the tax before transferring the inherited property.﻿﻿
Debenture,"A debenture is a type of bond or other debt instrument that is unsecured by collateral. Since debentures have no collateral backing, they must rely on the creditworthiness and reputation of the issuer for support. Both corporations and governments frequently issue debentures to raise capital or funds."
Debit Balance,The debit balance in a margin account is the total amount of money owed by the customer to a broker or other lender for funds borrowed to purchase securities. The debit balance is the amount of cash the customer must have in the account following the execution of a security purchase order so that the transaction can be settled properly.
Debit Card,"A debit card is a payment card that deducts money directly from a consumer’s checking account when it is used. Also called “check cards” or ""bank cards,"" they can be used to buy goods or services; or to get cash from an automated teller machine or a merchant who'll let you add an extra amount onto a purchase."
Debit Note,"A debit note is a document used by a vendor to inform the buyer of current debt obligations, or a document created by a buyer when returning goods received on credit. The debit note can provide information regarding an upcoming invoice or serve as a reminder for funds currently due. For returned items, the note will include the total anticipated credit, an inventory of the returned items, and the reason for their return."
Debt,"Debt is something, usually money, borrowed by one party from another. Debt is used by many corporations and individuals to make large purchases that they could not afford under normal circumstances. A debt arrangement gives the borrowing party permission to borrow money under the condition that it is to be paid back at a later date, usually with interest."
Debt Collector,"A debt collector is a company or agency that is in the business of recovering money owed on delinquent accounts. Many debt collectors are hired by companies to which money is owed by debtors, operating for a fee or for a percentage of the total amount collected. Some debt collectors are debt buyers; these companies purchase debt at a fraction of its face value and then attempt to recover the full amount of the debt."
Debt Consolidation,"Debt consolidation refers to the act of taking out a new loan to pay off other liabilities and consumer debts. Multiple debts are combined into a single, larger debt, such as a loan, usually with more favorable payoff terms—a lower interest rate, lower monthly payment, or both. Debt consolidation can be used as a tool to deal with student loan debt, credit card debt, and other liabilities."
Debt/EBITDA Ratio,"Debt/EBITDA—earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization—is a ratio measuring the amount of income generated and available to pay down debt before covering interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization expenses. Debt/EBITDA measures a company's ability to pay off its incurred debt. A high ratio result could indicate a company has a too-heavy debt load."
Debt/Equity Swap,"A debt/equity swap is a transaction in which the obligations or debts of a company or individual are exchanged for something of value, namely, equity. In the case of a publicly-traded company, this generally entails an exchange of bonds for stock. The value of the stocks and bonds being exchanged is typically determined by the market at the time of the swap."
Debt Financing,"Debt financing occurs when a firm raises money for working capital or capital expenditures by selling debt instruments to individuals and/or institutional investors. In return for lending the money, the individuals or institutions become creditors and receive a promise that the principal and interest on the debt will be repaid. The other way to raise capital in debt markets is to issue shares of stock in a public offering; this is called equity financing."
Debt Fund,"A debt fund is an investment pool, such as a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund, in which the core holdings comprise fixed income investments. A debt fund may invest in short-term or long-term bonds, securitized products, money market instruments or floating rate debt. On average, the fee ratios on debt funds are lower than those attached to equity funds because the overall management costs are lower."
Debt Instrument,"A debt instrument is a tool an entity can utilize to raise capital. It is a documented, binding obligation that provides funds to an entity in return for a promise from the entity to repay a lender or investor in accordance with terms of a contract. Debt instrument contracts include detailed provisions on the deal such as collateral involved, the rate of interest, the schedule for interest payments, and the timeframe to maturity if applicable."
Debt Issue,"A debt issue refers to a financial obligation that allows the issuer to raise funds by promising to repay the lender at a certain point in the future and in accordance with the terms of the contract. A debt issue is a fixed corporate or government obligation such as a bond or debenture. Debt issues also include notes, certificates, mortgages, leases, or other agreements between the issuer or borrower, and the lender."
Debt Overhang,"Debt overhang refers to a debt burden so large that an entity cannot take on additional debt to finance future projects. This includes entities that are profitable enough to be able to reduce indebtedness over time. A debt overhang serves to dissuade current investment, since all earnings from new projects would only go to existing debt holders, leaving little incentive and ability for the entity to attempt to dig itself out of the hole."
Debt Ratio,"The debt ratio is a financial ratio that measures the extent of a company’s leverage. The debt ratio is defined as the ratio of total debt to total assets, expressed as a decimal or percentage. It can be interpreted as the proportion of a company’s assets that are financed by debt."
Debt Restructuring,"Debt restructuring is a process used by companies, individuals, and even countries to avoid the risk of defaulting on their existing debts, such as by negotiating lower interest rates. Debt restructuring provides a less expensive alternative to bankruptcy when a debtor is in financial turmoil, and it can work to the benefit of both borrower and lender."
Debt Security,"A debt security is a debt instrument that can be bought or sold between two parties and has basic terms defined, such as the notional amount (the amount borrowed), interest rate, and maturity and renewal date."
Debt Service,"Debt service is the cash that is required to cover the repayment of interest and principal on a debt for a particular period. If an individual is taking out a mortgage or a student loan, the borrower needs to calculate the annual or monthly debt service required on each loan. In the same way, companies must meet debt service requirements for loans and bonds issued to the public. The ability to service debt is a factor when a company needs to raise additional capital to operate the business."
Debt-Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR),"The debt-service coverage ratio applies to corporate, government, and personal finance. In the context of corporate finance, the debt-service coverage ratio (DSCR) is a measurement of a firm's available cash flow to pay current debt obligations. The DSCR shows investors whether a company has enough income to pay its debts."
Debt-to-Capital Ratio,"The debt-to-capital ratio is a measurement of a company's financial leverage. The debt-to-capital ratio is calculated by taking the company's interest-bearing debt, both short- and long-term liabilities and dividing it by the total capital. Total capital is all interest-bearing debt plus shareholders' equity, which may include items such as common stock, preferred stock, and minority interest."
Debt-to-Equity Ratio (D/E),The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is used to evaluate a company's financial leverage and is calculated by dividing a company’s total liabilities by its shareholder equity.
Debt-to-GDP Ratio,"The debt-to-GDP ratio is the metric comparing a country's public debt to its gross domestic product (GDP). By comparing what a country owes with what it produces, the debt-to-GDP ratio reliably indicates that particular country’s ability to pay back its debts. Often expressed as a percentage, this ratio can also be interpreted as the number of years needed to pay back debt, if GDP is dedicated entirely to debt repayment."
Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI),The debt-to-income (DTI) ratio is the percentage of your gross monthly income that goes to paying your monthly debt payments and is used by lenders to determine your borrowing risk.
Debtor,"A debtor is a company or individual who owes money. If the debt is in the form of a loan from a financial institution, the debtor is referred to as a borrower, and if the debt is in the form of securities—such as bonds—the debtor is referred to as an issuer. Legally, someone who files a voluntary petition to declare bankruptcy is also considered a debtor."
Debtor in Possession (DIP),"A debtor in possession (DIP) is a person or corporation that has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection but still holds property to which creditors have a legal claim under a lien or other security interest. A DIP may continue to do business using those assets. However, it is required to seek court approval for any actions that fall outside the scope of regular business activities. The DIP must also keep precise financial records, insure any property, and file appropriate tax returns."
Debtor-in-Possession Financing (DIP Financing),"Debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing is a special kind of financing meant for companies that are in bankruptcy. Only companies that have filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 are allowed to access DIP financing, which usually happens at the start of a filing. DIP financing is used to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor-in-possession (the status of a company that has filed for bankruptcy) by allowing it to raise capital to fund its operations as its bankruptcy case runs its course. DIP financing is unique from other financing methods in that it usually has priority over existing debt, equity, and other claims."
Decentralized Applications (dApps),"Decentralized applications (dApps) are digital applications or programs that exist and run on a blockchain or P2P network of computers instead of a single computer, and are outside the purview and control of a single authority."
Decision Analysis (DA),"Decision analysis (DA) is a systematic, quantitative, and visual approach to addressing and evaluating the important choices that businesses sometimes face. Ronald A. Howard, a professor of Management Science and Engineering at Stanford University, is credited with originating the term in 1964. The idea is used by large and small corporations alike when making various types of decisions, including management, operations, marketing, capital investments, or strategic choices."
Decision Support Systems (DSS),"A decision support system (DSS) is a computerized program used to support determinations, judgments, and courses of action in an organization or a business. A DSS sifts through and analyzes massive amounts of data, compiling comprehensive information that can be used to solve problems and in decision-making."
Decision Theory,Decision theory is an interdisciplinary approach to arrive at the decisions that are the most advantageous given an uncertain environment.
Decision Tree,"A decision tree is a diagram or chart that helps determine a course of action or show a statistical probability. The chart is called a decision tree due to its resemblance to the namesake plant, usually outlined as an upright or a horizontal diagram that branches out. Starting from the decision itself (called a ""node""), each ""branch"" of the decision tree represents a possible decision, outcome, or reaction. The furthest branches on the tree represent the end results of a certain decision pathway and are called the ""leaves""."
Declaration Of Trust,A declaration of trust under U.S. law is a document or an oral statement appointing a trustee to oversee assets being held for the benefit of one or more other individuals. These assets are held in a trust.
Declining Balance Method,The declining balance method is an accelerated depreciation system of recording larger depreciation expenses during the earlier years of an asset’s useful life and recording smaller depreciation expenses during the asset's later years.
Decoupling,"Decoupling is what it's called when the returns of one asset class diverges from their expected or normal pattern of correlation with others. Decoupling takes place when different asset classes that typically rise and fall together start to move in opposite directions, such as one increasing and the other decreasing."
Decreasing Term Insurance,"Decreasing term insurance is renewable term life insurance with coverage decreasing over the life of the policy at a predetermined rate. Premiums are usually constant throughout the contract, and reductions in coverage typically occur monthly or annually. Terms range between 1 year and 30 years but it depends on the insurance company and the plan they offer."
Deductible,"For tax purposes, a deductible is an expense that an individual taxpayer or a business can subtract from adjusted gross income while completing a tax form. The deductible expense reduces reported income and therefore the amount of income taxes owed."
Deduction,A deduction is an expense that can be subtracted from a taxpayer's gross income in order to reduce the amount of income that is subject to taxation.
Deed,A deed is a signed legal document that grants its holder specific rights to an asset—provided they meet a number of conditions. Deeds are most commonly used to transfer the ownership of automobiles or land between two parties.
Deed Of Reconveyance,"A mortgage holder issues a deed of reconveyance to indicate that the borrower has been released from the mortgage debt. The deed transfers the property title from the lender, also called the beneficiary, to the borrower."
Deed of Release,A deed of release is a legal document that removes a previous claim on an asset. It provides documentation of release from a binding agreement. A deed of release might be included when a lender transfers the title of real estate to the homeowner upon satisfaction of the mortgage. A deed of release literally releases the parties from previous obligations.
Deep Learning,Deep learning is an artificial intelligence (AI) function that imitates the workings of the human brain in processing data and creating patterns for use in decision making. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in artificial intelligence that has networks capable of learning unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled. Also known as deep neural learning or deep neural network.
Deep In The Money,Deep in the money is an option that has an exercise or strike price significantly below (for a call option) or above (for a put option) the market price of the underlying asset. The value of such an option is nearly all intrinsic value and minimal extrinsic or time value. Deep in the money options have deltas at or close to 100.
Default Rate,The default rate is the percentage of all outstanding loans that a lender has written off as unpaid after a prolonged period of missed payments. The term default rate–also called penalty rate–may also refer to the higher interest rate imposed on a borrower who has missed regular payments on a loan.
Default Risk,"Default risk is the risk that a lender takes on in the chance that a borrower will be unable to make the required payments on their debt obligation. Lenders and investors are exposed to default risk in virtually all forms of credit extensions. A higher level of default risk leads to a higher required return, and in turn, a higher interest rate."
Defeasance,"Defeasance is a provision in a contract that voids a bond or loan on a balance sheet when the borrower sets aside cash or bonds sufficient enough to service the debt. The borrower sets aside cash to pay off the bonds; therefore, the outstanding debt and cash offset each other on the balance sheet and do not need to be recorded."
Defensive Interval Ratio,"The defensive interval ratio (DIR), also called the defensive interval period (DIP) or basic defense interval (BDI), is a financial metric that indicates the number of days that a company can operate without needing to access noncurrent assets, long-term assets whose full value cannot be obtained within the current accounting year, or additional outside financial resources."
Defensive Stock,"A defensive stock is a stock that provides consistent dividends and stable earnings regardless of the state of the overall stock market. There is a constant demand for their products, so defensive stocks tend to be more stable during the various phases of the business cycle. Defensive stocks should not be confused with defense stocks, which are the stocks of companies that manufacture things like weapons, ammunition, and fighter jets."
Deferment Period,The deferment period is a time during which a borrower does not have to pay interest or repay the principal on a loan. The deferment period also refers to the period after the issue of a callable security during which the issuer can not call the security.
Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC),Deferred acquisition costs (DAC) is an accounting method that is applicable in the insurance industry. Using the DAC method allows a company to defer the sales costs that are associated with acquiring a new customer over the term of the insurance contract.
Deferred Annuity,"A deferred annuity is a contract with an insurance company that promises to pay the owner a regular income, or a lump sum, at some future date. Investors often use deferred annuities to supplement their other retirement income, such as Social Security. Deferred annuities differ from immediate annuities, which begin making payments right away."
Deferred Compensation,"Deferred compensation is a portion of an employee's compensation that is set aside to be paid at a later date. In most cases, taxes on this income are deferred until it is paid out. Forms of deferred compensation include retirement plans, pension plans, and stock-option plans."
Deferred Income Tax,"A deferred income tax is a liability recorded on a balance sheet resulting from a difference in income recognition between tax laws and the company's accounting methods. For this reason, the company's payable income tax may not equate to the total tax expense reported."
Deferred Interest,"Deferred interest is when interest payments are deferred on a loan during a specific period of time. You will not pay any interest as long as your entire balance on the loan is paid off before this period ends. If you do not pay off the loan balance before this period ends, then interest charges start accruing."
Deferred Profit Sharing Plan (DPSP),"A deferred profit sharing plan (DPSP) is an employer-sponsored Canadian profit sharing plan that is registered with the Canadian Revenue Agency, which is basically the Canadian version of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States.﻿﻿"
Deferred Revenue,"Deferred revenue, also known as unearned revenue, refers to advance payments a company receives for products or services that are to be delivered or performed in the future. The company that receives the prepayment records the amount as deferred revenue, a liability, on its balance sheet."
Deferred Tax Asset,"Items on a company's balance sheet that may be used to reduce taxable income in the future are called deferred tax assets. The situation can happen when a business overpaid taxes or paid taxes in advance on its balance sheet. These taxes are eventually returned to the business in the form of tax relief. Therefore, overpayment is considered an asset to the company. A deferred tax asset is the opposite of a deferred tax liability, which can increase the amount of income tax owed by a company."
Deferred Tax Liability,"A deferred tax liability is a tax that is assessed or is due for the current period but has not yet been paid—meaning that it will eventually come due. The deferral comes from the difference in timing between when the tax is accrued and when the tax is paid. A deferred tax liability records the fact the company will, in the future, pay more income tax because of a transaction that took place during the current period, such as an installment sale receivable."
Deficit,"In financial terms, a deficit occurs when expenses exceed revenues, imports exceed exports, or liabilities exceed assets. A deficit is synonymous with a shortfall or loss and is the opposite of a surplus. A deficit can occur when a government, company, or person spends more than it receives in a given period, usually a year."
Deficit Spending,"In the simplest terms, deficit spending is when a government's expenditures exceed its revenues during a fiscal period, causing it to run a budget deficit. The phrase ""deficit spending"" often implies a Keynesian approach to economic stimulus, in which the government takes on debt while using its spending power to create demand and stimulate the economy."
Deficit Spending Unit,"A deficit spending unit is an economic term used to describe how an economy, or an economic group within that economy, has spent more than it has earned over a specified measurement period. Both companies and governments may experience a deficit spending unit."
Defined-Benefit Plan,"A defined-benefit plan is an employer-sponsored retirement plan where employee benefits are computed using a formula that considers several factors, such as length of employment and salary history.﻿﻿ The company is responsible for managing the plan's investments and risk and will usually hire an outside investment manager to do this. Typically an employee cannot just withdraw funds as with a 401(k) plan. Rather they become eligible to take their benefit as a lifetime annuity or in some cases as a lump-sum at an age defined by the plan's rules."
Defined-Contribution Plan,"A defined-contribution (DC) plan is a retirement plan that's typically tax-deferred, like a 401(k) or a 403(b), in which employees contribute a fixed amount or a percentage of their paychecks to an account that is intended to fund their retirements. The sponsor company will, at times, match a portion of employee contributions as an added benefit. These plans place restrictions that control when and how each employee can withdraw from these accounts without penalties."
Degree of Combined Leverage,"A degree of combined leverage (DCL) is a leverage ratio that summarizes the combined effect that the degree of operating leverage (DOL) and the degree of financial leverage has on earnings per share (EPS), given a particular change in sales. This ratio can be used to help determine the most optimal level of financial and operating leverage to use in any firm."
Degree of Financial Leverage,"A degree of financial leverage (DFL) is a leverage ratio that measures the sensitivity of a company’s earnings per share (EPS) to fluctuations in its operating income, as a result of changes in its capital structure. The degree of financial leverage (DFL) measures the percentage change in EPS for a unit change in operating income, also known as earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)."
Degree of Operating Leverage,The degree of operating leverage (DOL) is a multiple that measures how much the operating income of a company will change in response to a change in sales. Companies with a large proportion of fixed costs (or costs that don't change with production) to variable costs (costs that change with production volume) have higher levels of operating leverage.
Degrees of Freedom,"Degrees of Freedom refers to the maximum number of logically independent values, which are values that have the freedom to vary, in the data sample."
Delaware Corporations,"A Delaware corporation is a company that is legally registered in the state of Delaware but may conduct business in any state. Delaware first began to adapt its laws in the late 19th century, making changes that would attract businesses away from other states such as New York. Over time, Delaware became a respected state in which to incorporate, even if the majority of a company's business was conducted outside the state."
Delayed Draw Term Loan,"A delayed draw term loan (DDTL) is a special feature in a term loan that lets a borrower withdraw predefined amounts of a total pre-approved loan amount. The withdrawal periods—such as every three, six, or nine months—are also determined in advance. A DDTL is included as a provision of the borrower's agreement, which lenders may offer to businesses with high credit standings. A DDTL is often included in contractual loan deals for businesses who use the loan proceeds as financing for future acquisitions or expansion."
Deleveraging,"Deleveraging is when a company or individual attempts to decrease its total financial leverage. In other words, deleveraging is the reduction of debt and the opposite of leveraging. The most direct way for an entity to deleverage is to immediately pay off any existing debts and obligations on its balance sheet. If unable to do this, the company or individual may be in a position of an increased risk of default."
Delinquency Rate,"Delinquency rate refers to the percentage of loans within a financial institution's loan portfolio whose payments are delinquent. When analyzing and investing in loans, the delinquency rate is an important metric to follow; it is easy to find comprehensive statistics on the delinquencies of all types of loans."
Delinquent,"Delinquent describes something or someone who fails to accomplish that which is required by law, duty, or contractual agreement, such as the failure to make a required payment or perform a particular action."
Delinquent Account Credit Card,"From the perspective of a credit card company, a particular credit card is said to be delinquent if the customer in question has failed to make their minimum monthly payment for 30 days from their original due date."
Delisting,"Delisting is the removal of a listed security from a stock exchange. The delisting of a security can be voluntary or involuntary and usually results when a company ceases operations, declares bankruptcy, merges, does not meet listing requirements, or seeks to become private."
Deliverables,"The term ""deliverables"" is a project management term that's traditionally used to describe the quantifiable goods or services that must be provided upon the completion of a project. Deliverables can be tangible or intangible in nature. For example, in a project focusing on upgrading a firm's technology, a deliverable may refer to the acquisition of a dozen new computers."
Delivered at Frontier (DAF),Delivered at frontier (DAF) is a term used in international shipping contracts that requires a seller to deliver goods to a border location. The seller is usually responsible for all costs of transporting the goods to the drop-off point for the buyer.

Delivered-at-Place (DAP),"Delivered-at-place (DAP) is an international trade term used to describe a deal in which a seller agrees to pay all costs and suffer any potential losses of moving goods sold to a specific location. In delivered-at-place agreements, the buyer is responsible for paying import duties and any applicable taxes, including clearance and local taxes, once the shipment has arrived at the specified destination."
Delivered Duty Paid (DDP),"Delivered duty paid (DDP) is a delivery agreement whereby the seller assumes all of the responsibility, risk, and costs associated with transporting goods until the buyer receives or transfers them at the destination port. This agreement includes paying for shipping costs, export and import duties, insurance, and any other expenses incurred during shipping to an agreed-upon location in the buyer's country."
Delivered Duty Unpaid (DDU),"Delivered Duty Unpaid (DDU) is an old international trade term indicating that the seller is responsible for the safe delivery of goods to a named destination, paying all transportation expenses, and assuming all risks during transport."
Delivered Ex Ship (DES),"Delivered ex-ship (DES) was a trade term that required a seller to deliver goods to a buyer at an agreed port of arrival. The seller met its obligation upon delivery of uncleared goods in a designated port. It assumed the full cost and risk involved in getting the goods to that point, at which time it was available to the buyer and the buyer assumed all ensuing costs and risks."
Delivery Versus Payment (DVP),Delivery versus payment (DVP) is a securities industry settlement method that guarantees the transfer of securities only happens after payment has been made. DVP stipulates that the buyer's cash payment for securities must be made prior to or at the same time as the delivery of the security.

Delta Neutral,Delta neutral is a portfolio strategy utilizing multiple positions with balancing positive and negative deltas so that the overall delta of the assets in question totals zero.
Demand,"Demand is an economic principle referring to a consumer's desire to purchase goods and services and willingness to pay a price for a specific good or service. Holding all other factors constant, an increase in the price of a good or service will decrease the quantity demanded, and vice versa. Market demand is the total quantity demanded across all consumers in a market for a given good. Aggregate demand is the total demand for all goods and services in an economy. Multiple stocking strategies are often required to handle demand."
Demand Curve,"The demand curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity demanded for a given period of time. In a typical representation, the price will appear on the left vertical axis, the quantity demanded on the horizontal axis."
Demand Deposit,"A demand deposit account (DDA) is a bank account from which deposited funds can be withdrawn at any time, without advance notice. DDA accounts can pay interest on the deposited funds but aren’t required to. Checking accounts and savings accounts are common types of DDAs."
Demand Draft,"A demand draft is a method used by an individual to make a transfer payment from one bank account to another. Demand drafts differ from regular normal checks in that they do not require signatures to be cashed. In 2005, due to the increasing fraudulent use of demand drafts, the Federal Reserve proposed new regulations increasing a victim's right to claim a refund and holding banks more accountable for cashing fraudulent checks.﻿﻿"
Demand Elasticity,"Price elasticity of demand is a measurement of the change in consumption of a product in relation to a change in its price. Expressed mathematically, it is:"
Demand for Labor,"When producing goods and services, businesses require labor and capital as inputs to their production process. The demand for labor is an economics principle derived from the demand for a firm's output. That is, if demand for a firm's output increases, the firm will demand more labor, thus hiring more staff. And if demand for the firm's output of goods and services decreases, in turn, it will require less labor and its demand for labor will fall, and less staff will be retained."
Demand-Pull Inflation,"Demand-pull inflation is the upward pressure on prices that follows a shortage in supply, a condition that economists describe as ""too many dollars chasing too few goods."""
Demand Schedules,"In economics, a demand schedule is a table that shows the quantity demanded of a good or service at different price levels. A demand schedule can be graphed as a continuous demand curve on a chart where the Y-axis represents price and the X-axis represents quantity."
Demand Shock,"A demand shock is a sudden unexpected event that dramatically increases or decreases demand for a product or service, usually temporarily. A positive demand shock is a sudden increase in demand, while a negative demand shock is a decrease in demand. Either shock will have an effect on the prices of the product or service."
Demand Theory,"Demand theory is an economic principle relating to the relationship between consumer demand for goods and services and their prices in the market. Demand theory forms the basis for the demand curve, which relates consumer desire to the amount of goods available. As more of a good or service is available, demand drops and so does the equilibrium price."
Dematerialization (DEMAT),Dematerialization (DEMAT) is the move from physical certificates to electronic bookkeeping. Actual stock certificates are then removed and retired from circulation in exchange for electronic recording.
Demographic Dividend,Demographic dividend refers to the growth in an economy that is the result of a change in the age structure of a country’s population. The change in age structure is typically brought on by a decline in fertility and mortality rates.
Demographics,"Demographic analysis is the study of a population based on factors such as age, race, and sex. Demographic data refers to socioeconomic information expressed statistically including employment, education, income, marriage rates, birth and death rates, and more."
Demonetization,"Demonetization is the act of stripping a currency unit of its status as legal tender. It occurs whenever there is a change of national currency. The current form or forms of money is pulled from circulation and retired, often to be replaced with new notes or coins. Sometimes, a country completely replaces the old currency with new currency."

Dependency Ratio,"The dependency ratio is a measure of the number of dependents aged zero to 14 and over the age of 65, compared with the total population aged 15 to 64. This demographic indicator gives insight into the number of people of non-working age, compared with the number of those of working age. It is also used to understand the relative economic burden of the workforce and has ramifications for taxation. The dependency ratio is also referred to as the total or youth dependency ratio."
Dependent Care Benefits,"Dependent care benefits are provided by an employer to an employee for use in caring for dependents, such as young children or disabled family members. Dependent care benefits may include flexible spending accounts (FSAs), paid leave, and certain tax credits and can be worth thousands of dollars to eligible participants."

Deposit at Custodian (DWAC),"Deposit/withdrawal at custodian (DWAC) is a method of electronically transferring new shares or paper share certificates to and from the Depository Trust Company (DTC) using a Fast Automated Securities Transfer (FAST) service transfer agent as the distribution point. The DWAC is one of two ways of transferring between broker/dealers and the DTC, the other being the Direct Registry System (DRS) method. Both enable investors to hold securities in registered form on the books of the transfer agent, rather than in physical form. DRS is different from DWAC in that shares in DRS have already been issued and are held electronically on the books of the transfer agent."
Deposit Multiplier,The deposit multiplier is the maximum amount of money a bank can create for each unit of reserves. The deposit multiplier is normally a percentage of the amount on deposit at the bank. The deposit multiplier requirement is key to maintaining an economy's basic money supply. Reliance on a deposit multiplier is called a fractional reserve banking system and is now common to banks in most nations around the world.

Founded in 1973 and based in New York City, the DTC is organized as a limited purpose trust company and provides safekeeping through electronic record-keeping of securities balances. It also acts as a clearinghouse to process and settle trades in corporate and municipal securities."
Depreciated Cost,"Depreciated cost is the value of a fixed asset minus all of the accumulated depreciation that has been recorded against it. In a broader economic sense, the depreciated cost is the aggregate amount of capital that is ""used up"" in a given period, such as a fiscal year. The depreciated cost can be examined for trends in a company's capital spending and how aggressive their accounting methods are, seen through how accurately they calculate depreciation. Depreciated cost is also known as the ""salvage value,"" ""net book value,"" or ""adjusted cost basis."""
"Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization (DD&A)","Depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD&A) is an accounting technique that enables companies to gradually expense various different resources of economic value over time in order to match costs to revenues."
Depreciation Recapture,"Depreciation recapture is the gain realized by the sale of depreciable capital property that must be reported as ordinary income for tax purposes. Depreciation recapture is assessed when the sale price of an asset exceeds the tax basis or adjusted cost basis. The difference between these figures is thus ""recaptured"" by reporting it as ordinary income."
Depth of Market (DOM),"Depth of market (DOM) is a measure of the supply and demand for liquid, tradeable assets. It is based on the number of open buy and sell orders for a given asset such as a stock or futures contract. The greater the quantity of those orders, the deeper or more liquid, the market is considered to be."
Deregulation,"Deregulation is the reduction or elimination of government power in a particular industry, usually enacted to create more competition within the industry. Over the years, the struggle between proponents of regulation and proponents of no government intervention has shifted market conditions. Finance has historically been one of the most heavily scrutinized industries in the United States."
Derived Demand,"Derived demand—in economics—is the demand for a good or service that results from the demand for a different, or related, good or service. It is a demand for some physical or intangible thing where a market exists for both related goods and services in question. Derived demand can have a significant impact on the derived product's market price."
Descending Triangle,"A descending triangle is a bearish chart pattern used in technical analysis that is created by drawing one trend line that connects a series of lower highs and a second horizontal trend line that connects a series of lows. Oftentimes, traders watch for a move below the lower support trend line because it suggests that the downward momentum is building and a breakdown is imminent. Once the breakdown occurs, traders enter into short positions and aggressively help push the price of the asset even lower."
Descriptive Statistics,"Descriptive statistics are brief descriptive coefficients that summarize a given data set, which can be either a representation of the entire or a sample of a population. Descriptive statistics are broken down into measures of central tendency and measures of variability (spread). Measures of central tendency include the mean, median, and mode, while measures of variability include standard deviation, variance, minimum and maximum variables, kurtosis, and skewness."
Developed Economy,"A developed economy is typically characteristic of a developed country with a relatively high level of economic growth and security. Standard criteria for evaluating a country's level of development are income per capita or per capita gross domestic product, the level of industrialization, the general standard of living, and the amount of technological infrastructure."
Development Economics,"Development economics is a branch of economics that focuses on improving fiscal, economic, and social conditions in developing countries. Development economics considers factors such as health, education, working conditions, domestic and international policies, and market conditions with a focus on improving conditions in the world's poorest countries."

Digital Option,"A binary option is a financial product where the parties involved in the transaction are assigned one of two outcomes based on whether the option expires in the money. Binary options depend on the outcome of a ""yes or no"" proposition, hence the name ""binary."" Traders receive a payout if the binary option expires in the money and incur a loss if it expires out of the money."
Diluted Earnings per Share (Diluted EPS),"Diluted EPS is a calculation used to gauge the quality of a company's earnings per share (EPS) if all convertible securities were exercised. Convertible securities are all outstanding convertible preferred shares, convertible debentures, stock options, and warrants. The diluted EPS will usually be lower than the simple or basic EPS but in the rare case that there are anti-dilutive securities it may be higher. In this case only the basic EPS is reported in the financial statements."
Dilution,"Dilution occurs when a company issues new shares that result in a decrease in existing stockholders' ownership percentage of that company. Stock dilution can also occur when holders of stock options, such as company employees, or holders of other optionable securities exercise their options. When the number of shares outstanding increases, each existing stockholder owns a smaller, or diluted, percentage of the company, making each share less valuable."
Dim Sum Bond,"Dim sum bond' is a slang term for bonds denominated in Chinese renminbi and issued in Hong Kong. Dim sum bonds are attractive to foreign investors who desire exposure to renminbi-denominated assets, but are restricted by China's capital controls from investing in domestic Chinese debt.	investopedia	1	40.18	13.2	0	13.41	15.3	11.77	14	15.75	15.22	15th and 16th grade	81.9	76.35	36.45	4.2	48.33333333	40.39
Direct Cost	A direct cost is a price that can be directly tied to the production of specific goods or services. A direct cost can be traced to the cost object, which can be a service, product, or department. Direct and indirect costs are the two major types of expenses or costs that companies can incur. Direct costs are often variable costs, meaning they fluctuate with production levels such as inventory. However, some costs, such as indirect costs are more difficult to assign to a specific product. Examples of indirect costs include depreciation and administrative expenses.	investopedia	1	55.54	9.4	13.3	11.08	10.2	8.78	22	11	11.81	10th and 11th grade	94.8	89.1	41.84	3.3	57.5106383	57.3
Direct Deposit	The term direct deposit refers to the deposit of funds electronically into a bank account rather than through a physical, paper check. Direct deposit requires the use of an electronic network that allows deposits to take place between banks. This network is called the automated clearing house (ACH). Because the funds are transferred electronically, recipients' accounts are credited automatically, so there is no need to wait for the money to clear. Common uses for direct deposit include paychecks, tax refunds, and other benefits.	investopedia	1	46.17	10.9	10.8	13.11	12.5	9.22	20	10.1	10.5	10th and 11th grade	87.9	87.4	38.09	3.4	52.61445783	45.56
Direct Investment	Direct investment is more commonly referred to as foreign direct investment (FDI). FDI refers to an investment in a foreign business enterprise designed to acquire a controlling interest in the enterprise.

Direct Market Access (DMA)	Direct market access (DMA) refers to access to the electronic facilities and order books of financial market exchanges that facilitate daily securities transactions. Direct market access requires a sophisticated technology infrastructure and is often owned by sell-side firms. Rather than relying on market-making firms and broker-dealers to execute trades, some buy-side firms use direct market access to place trades themselves.	investopedia	1	25.8	14.6	15	17.64	17.7	10.68	17	14.33333333	15.33	14th and 15th grade	72.4	69.5	29.84	4.8	42.16666667	20.09
Direct Marketing	Direct marketing consists of any marketing that relies on direct communication or distribution to individual consumers, rather than through a third party such as mass media. Mail, email, social media, and texting campaigns are among the delivery systems used. It is called direct marketing because it generally eliminates the middleman, such as advertising media.	investopedia	1	27.15	16.2	0	15.55	19.2	10.82	17	12.66666667	17.47	15th and 16th grade	71.3	67.93	31.32	4.6	42.51851852	27.85

Direct Public Offering (DPO),"A direct public offering (DPO) is a type of offering in which a company offers its securities directly to the public to raise capital. An issuing company using a DPO eliminates the intermediaries—investment banks, broker-dealers, and underwriters—that are typical in initial public offerings (IPO), and self-underwrites its securities."
Direct Quote,"A direct quote is a foreign exchange rate quoted in fixed units of foreign currency in variable amounts of the domestic currency. In other words, a direct currency quote asks what amount of domestic currency is needed to buy one unit of the foreign currency—most commonly the U.S. dollar (USD) in forex markets. In a direct quote, the foreign currency is the base currency, while the domestic currency is the counter currency or quote currency."
Direct Stock Purchase Plan (DSPP),"A direct stock purchase plan (DSPP) is a program that enables individual investors to purchase a company's stock directly from that company without the intervention of a broker. Some companies that offer DSPPs make the plans directly available to retail investors, while others use transfer agents or other third-party administrators to handle these transactions. Such plans offer low fees and sometimes the ability to purchase shares at a discount."
Direct Tax,"A direct tax is a tax that a person or organization pays directly to the entity that imposed it. An individual taxpayer, for example, pays direct taxes to the government for various purposes, including income tax, real property tax, personal property tax, or taxes on assets."
Directional Movement Index (DMI),"The directional movement index (DMI) is an indicator developed by J. Welles Wilder in 1978 that identifies in which direction the price of an asset is moving. The indicator does this by comparing prior highs and lows and drawing two lines: a positive directional movement line (+DI) and a negative directional movement line (-DI). An optional third line, called the average directional index (ADX), can also be used to gauge the strength of the uptrend or downtrend."
Dirty Price,"A dirty price is a bond pricing quote, which refers to the cost of a bond that includes accrued interest based on the coupon rate. Bond price quotes between coupon payment dates reflect the accrued interest up to the day of the quote."
Disability Insurance,"As its name suggests, disability insurance is a type of insurance product that provides income in the event that a policyholder is prevented from working and earning an income due to a disability."
What Is Disbursement?,"Disbursement means paying out money. The term disbursement may be used to describe money paid into a business' operating budget, the delivery of a loan amount to a borrower, or the payment of a dividend to shareholders. Money paid by an intermediary, such as a lawyer's payment to a third party on behalf of a client, may also be called a disbursement."

Discount Broker,"A discount broker is a stockbroker who carries out buy and sell orders at reduced commission rates compared to a full-service broker. However, a discount broker does not provide investment advice or perform analysis on a client's behalf, unlike a full-service broker. Before the emergence of better communications technology, only the wealthy could afford a broker and access to the stock market."
Discount Margin (DM),"A discount margin (DM) is the average expected return of a floating-rate security (typically a bond) that's earned in addition to the index underlying, or reference rate of, the security. The size of the discount margin depends on the price of the floating- or variable-rate security. The return of floating-rate securities changes over time, so the discount margin is an estimate based on the security's expected pattern between issue and maturity."
Discount Rate,"Depending upon the context, the discount rate has two different definitions and usages. First, the discount rate refers to the interest rate charged to the commercial banks and other financial institutions for the loans they take from the Federal Reserve Bank through the discount window loan process. Second, the discount rate refers to the interest rate used in discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis to determine the present value of future cash flows."
Discount Yield,"The discount yield is a way of calculating a bond's return when it is sold at a discount to its face value, expressed as a percentage. Discount yield is commonly used to calculate the yield on municipal notes, commercial paper and treasury bills sold at a discount."
Discounted Cash Flow (DCF),"Discounted cash flow (DCF) is a valuation method used to estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. DCF analysis attempts to figure out the value of an investment today, based on projections of how much money it will generate in the future."
Discounted Payback Periods,"The discounted payback period is a capital budgeting procedure used to determine the profitability of a project. A discounted payback period gives the number of years it takes to break even from undertaking the initial expenditure, by discounting future cash flows and recognizing the time value of money. The metric is used to evaluate the feasibility and profitability of a given project."
Discounts For Lack Of Marketability (DLOM),"Discounts for lack of marketability (DLOM) refer to the method used to help calculate the value of closely held and restricted shares. The theory behind DLOM is that a valuation discount exists between a stock that is publicly traded and thus has a market, and the market for privately held stock, which often has little if any marketplace."
Discouraged Worker,"A discouraged worker is a person who is eligible for employment and can work, but who is currently unemployed and has not attempted to find employment in the last four weeks. Discouraged workers usually have given up on searching for a job because they found no suitable employment options or failed to secure a job when they applied."
Discrete Distribution,"A discrete distribution is a probability distribution that depicts the occurrence of discrete (individually countable) outcomes, such as 1, 2, 3... or zero vs. one. The binomial distribution, for example, is a discrete distribution that evaluates the probability of a ""yes"" or ""no"" outcome occurring over a given number of trials, given the event's probability in each trial—such as flipping a coin one hundred times and having the outcome be ""heads""."
Discretionary Account,A discretionary account is an investment account that allows an authorized broker to buy and sell securities without the client's consent for each trade. The client must sign a discretionary disclosure with the broker as documentation of the client's consent.
Discretionary Expense,"A discretionary expense is a cost that a business or household can survive without, if necessary. Discretionary expenses are often defined as nonessential spending. This means a business or household is still able to maintain itself even if all discretionary consumer spending stops."

The term ""discretionary"" refers to the fact that investment decisions are made at the portfolio manager's discretion. This means that the client must have the utmost trust in the investment manager's capabilities."
Diseconomies of Scale,"Diseconomies of scale happen when a company or business grows so large that the costs per unit increase. It takes place when economies of scale no longer function for a firm. With this principle, rather than experiencing continued decreasing costs and increasing output, a firm sees an increase in costs when output is increased."
Disguised Unemployment,Disguised unemployment exists when part of the labor force is either left without work or is working in a redundant manner such that worker productivity is essentially zero. It is unemployment that does not affect aggregate output. An economy demonstrates disguised unemployment when productivity is low and too many workers are filling too few jobs.
Disintermediation,"Disintermediation is the process of cutting out the middleman. It may allow a consumer to buy directly from a wholesaler rather than through an intermediary such as a retailer. Or, it can enable a business to order directly from a manufacturer rather than from a distributor. In the financial industry, it is seen when an investor is able to buy stock directly rather than through a broker or a financial institution."
Dispersion,"Dispersion is a statistical term that describes the size of the distribution of values expected for a particular variable and can be measured by several different statistics, such as range, variance, and standard deviation. In finance and investing, dispersion usually refers to the range of possible returns on an investment. It can also be used to measure the risk inherent in a particular security or investment portfolio."
Disposable Income,"Disposable income, also known as disposable personal income (DPI), is the amount of money that an individual or household has to spend or save after income taxes have been deducted."
Disposition,"A disposition is the act of selling or otherwise ""disposing"" of an asset or security. The most common form of a disposition would be selling a stock investment on the open market, such as a stock exchange."
Disruptive Innovation,"Disruptive innovation refers to the innovation that transforms expensive or highly sophisticated products or services—previously accessible to a high-end or more-skilled segment of consumers—to those that are more affordable and accessible to a broader population. This transformation disrupts the market by displacing long-standing, established competitors."
Disruptive Technology,"Disruptive technology is an innovation that significantly alters the way that consumers, industries, or businesses operate. A disruptive technology sweeps away the systems or habits it replaces because it has attributes that are recognizably superior."
Dissenters' Rights,"Under various forms of state legislation, dissenting shareholders of a corporation are entitled to receive a cash payment for the fair value of their shares, in the event of a share-for-share merger or acquisition (M&A) to which the shareholders do not consent. Dissenters' rights allow dissenting shareholders an easy way out of the company if they do not want to be a part of the merger."
Distressed Sales,"A distress sale—also called a distressed sale—occurs when a property, stock, or other asset must be sold quickly. Distress sales often result in a financial loss for the seller who, for reasons of economic duress, must accept a lower price. The proceeds from these assets are most often used to pay debts or medical expenses or for other emergencies."
Distressed Securities,"Distressed securities are financial instruments issued by a company that is near to—or currently going through—bankruptcy. Distressed securities can include common and preferred shares, bank debt, trade claims, and corporate bonds."
Distributable Net Income (DNI),"The term distributable net income (DNI) refers to income allocated from a trust to its beneficiaries. Distributable net income is the maximum amount received by a unitholder or a beneficiary that is taxable. This figure is capped to ensure there is no instance of double taxation. Any amount above the DNI is, therefore, tax-free."
Distributed Ledger Technology,"Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) refers to the technological infrastructure and protocols that allows simultaneous access, validation, and record updating in an immutable manner across a network that's spread across multiple entities or locations."
Distributed Ledgers,"A distributed ledger is a database that is consensually shared and synchronized across multiple sites, institutions, or geographies, accessible by multiple people. It allows transactions to have public ""witnesses"". The participant at each node of the network can access the recordings shared across that network and can own an identical copy of it. Any changes or additions made to the ledger are reflected and copied to all participants in a matter of seconds or minutes."
Distribution Channel,"A distribution channel is a chain of businesses or intermediaries through which a good or service passes until it reaches the final buyer or the end consumer. Distribution channels can include wholesalers, retailers, distributors, and even the Internet."
Distribution In Kind,"A distribution-in-kind, also referred to as a distribution-in-specie, is a payment made in the form of securities or other property rather than in cash. A distribution-in-kind may be made in several different situations, including the payment of a stock dividend or inheritance, or taking securities out of a tax-deferred account. It can also refer to the transfer of an asset to a beneficiary over the option of liquidating the position and transferring the cash."
Distribution Management,"Distribution management refers to the process of overseeing the movement of goods from supplier or manufacturer to point of sale. It is an overarching term that refers to numerous activities and processes such as packaging, inventory, warehousing, supply chain, and logistics."
Distribution Network,"In a supply chain, a distribution network is an interconnected group of storage facilities and transportation systems that receive inventories of goods and then deliver them to customers. It is an intermediate point to get products from the manufacturer to the end customer, either directly or through a retail network. A fast and reliable distribution network is essential in today's instant gratification society of consumers."
Distribution Waterfall,"A distribution waterfall a way to allocate investment returns or capital gains among participants of a group or pooled investment. Commonly associated with private equity funds, the distribution waterfall defines the pecking order in which distributions are allocated to limited and general partners."
Distribution Yield,"A distribution yield is the measurement of cash flow paid by an exchange-traded fund (ETF), real estate investment trust, or another type of income-paying vehicle. Rather than calculating the yield based on an aggregate of distributions, the most recent distribution is annualized and divided by the net asset value (NAV) of the security at the time of the payment."
Divergence,"Divergence is when the price of an asset is moving in the opposite direction of a technical indicator, such as an oscillator, or is moving contrary to other data. Divergence warns that the current price trend may be weakening, and in some cases may lead to the price changing direction."
Diversified Company,A diversified company is a type of company that has multiple unrelated businesses or products. Unrelated businesses are those that:
Divestiture,"A divestiture is the partial or full disposal of a business unit through sale, exchange, closure, or bankruptcy. A divestiture most commonly results from a management decision to cease operating a business unit because it is not part of a core competency."
Divestment,"Divestment is the process of selling subsidiary assets, investments, or divisions of a company in order to maximize the value of the parent company. Also known as divestiture, divestment is effectively the opposite of an investment and is usually done when that subsidiary asset or division is not performing up to expectations."
Dividend Aristocrat,A dividend aristocrat is a company in the S&P 500 index that not only consistently pays a dividend to shareholders but annually increases the size of its payout.
Dividend Discount Model (DDM),"The dividend discount model (DDM) is a quantitative method used for predicting the price of a company's stock based on the theory that its present-day price is worth the sum of all of its future dividend payments when discounted back to their present value. It attempts to calculate the fair value of a stock irrespective of the prevailing market conditions and takes into consideration the dividend payout factors and the market expected returns. If the value obtained from the DDM is higher than the current trading price of shares, then the stock is undervalued and qualifies for a buy, and vice versa."
Dividend Growth Rate,The dividend growth rate is the annualized percentage rate of growth that a particular stock's dividend undergoes over a period of time. Many mature companies seek to increase the dividends paid to their investors on a regular basis. Knowing the dividend growth rate is a key input for stock valuation models known as dividend discount models.
Dividend Irrelevance Theory,Dividend irrelevance theory holds the belief that dividends don't have any effect on a company's stock price. A dividend is typically a cash payment made from a company's profits to its shareholders as a reward for investing in the company. The dividend irrelevance theory goes on to state that dividends can hurt a company's ability to be competitive in the long term since the money would be better off reinvested in the company to generate earnings.
Dividend Payout Ratio,The dividend payout ratio is the ratio of the total amount of dividends paid out to shareholders relative to the net income of the company. It is the percentage of earnings paid to shareholders in dividends. The amount that is not paid to shareholders is retained by the company to pay off debt or to reinvest in core operations. It is sometimes simply referred to as the 'payout ratio.'
Dividend Per Share (DPS),"Dividend per share (DPS) is the sum of declared dividends issued by a company for every ordinary share outstanding. The figure is calculated by dividing the total dividends paid out by a business, including interim dividends, over a period of time, usually a year, by the number of outstanding ordinary shares issued. A company's DPS is often derived using the dividend paid in the most recent quarter, which is also used to calculate the dividend yield."
Dividend Policy,"A dividend policy is the policy a company uses to structure its dividend payout to shareholders. Some researchers suggest the dividend policy is irrelevant, in theory, because investors can sell a portion of their shares or portfolio if they need funds. This is the dividend irrelevance theory, which infers that dividend payouts minimally affect a stock's price."
Dividend Rate,"The dividend rate is the total expected dividend payments from an investment, fund or portfolio expressed on an annualized basis plus any additional non-recurring dividends that an investor may receive during that period. Depending on the company's preferences and strategy, the dividend rate can be fixed or adjustable."
Dividend Recapitalization,"A dividend recapitalization (also known as a dividend recap) happens when a company takes on new debt in order to pay a special dividend to private investors or shareholders. This usually involves a company owned by a private investment firm, which can authorize a dividend recapitalization as an alternative to the company declaring regular dividends, based on earnings."
Dividends Received Deduction (DRD),"The dividends received deduction (DRD) is a federal tax deduction in the United States that is given to certain corporations that get dividends from related entities. The amount of the dividend that a company can deduct from its income tax is tied to how much ownership the company has in the dividend-paying company. However, there are criteria that corporations must meet in order to qualify for the dividends received deduction (DRD)."
Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP),"A dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) is a program that allows investors to reinvest their cash dividends into additional shares or fractional shares of the underlying stock on the dividend payment date. Although the term can apply to any automatic reinvestment arrangement set up through a brokerage or investment company, it generally refers to a formal program offered by a publicly traded corporation to existing shareholders. Around 650 companies and 500 closed-end funds currently do so."
Documentary Collection,"Documentary collection is a form of trade finance in which an exporter is paid for its goods by an importer after the two parties' banks exchange the required documents. The exporter's bank collects funds from the importer's bank in exchange for documents releasing title to the shipped merchandise, usually after the goods arrive at the importer's location."
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act,"The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was created as a response to the financial crisis of 2008. Named after sponsors Senator Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) and Representative Barney Frank (D-Mass.), the act contains numerous provisions, spelled out over roughly 2,300 pages, that were to be implemented over a period of several years."
Dogs of the Dow,"Dogs of the Dow is an investment strategy that attempts to beat the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) each year by leaning portfolios toward high-yield investments. The general concept is to allocate money to the 10 highest dividend-yielding, blue-chip stocks among the 30 components of the DJIA."
Doji,"A doji—or more accurately, ""dо̄ji""—is a name for a session in which the candlestick for a security has an open and close that are virtually equal and are often components in patterns. Doji candlesticks look like a cross, inverted cross or plus sign. Alone, doji are neutral patterns that are also featured in a number of important patterns."
Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA),"Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy in which an investor divides up the total amount to be invested across periodic purchases of a target asset in an effort to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase. The purchases occur regardless of the asset's price and at regular intervals. In effect, this strategy removes much of the detailed work of attempting to time the market in order to make purchases of equities at the best prices. Dollar-cost averaging is also known as the constant dollar plan."
Dollarization,"Dollarization is the term for when the U.S. dollar is used in addition to or instead of the domestic currency of another country. It is an example of currency substitution. Dollarization usually happens when a country’s own currency loses its usefulness as a medium of exchange, due to hyperinflation or instability."
Domestic Corporation,"A domestic corporation is a company that conducts its affairs in its home country. A domestic business is often taxed differently than a non-domestic business and may be required to pay duties or fees on the products it imports.

The parties involved are normally the employee and their spouse."
Domicile,Your domicile is the place where you maintain a permanent home. Your country of domicile means the country you permanently reside in.
Donchian Channels,"Donchian Channels are three lines generated by moving average calculations that comprise an indicator formed by upper and lower bands around a midrange or median band. The upper band marks the highest price of a security over N periods while the lower band marks the lowest price of a security over N periods. The area between the upper and lower bands represents the Donchian Channel. Career futures trader Richard Donchian developed the indicator in the mid-20th century to help him identify trends. He would later be nicknamed ""The Father of Trend Following."""
Dormant Account,"A dormant account is an account that has had no financial activity for a long period of time, except for the posting of interest. Financial institutions are required by state laws to transfer resources held in dormant accounts to the state's treasury after the accounts have been dormant for a certain period of time.

Dotcom,"A dotcom, or dot-com, is a company that conducts business primarily through a website. A dotcom company embraces the Internet as the key component in its business."
Dotcom Bubble,"The dotcom bubble was a rapid rise in U.S. technology stock equity valuations fueled by investments in Internet-based companies during the bull market in the late 1990s. The value of equity markets grew exponentially during this period, with the technology-dominated Nasdaq index rising from under 1,000 to more than 5,000 between the years 1995 and 2000. Things started to change in 2000, and the bubble burst between 2001 and 2002 with equities entering a bear market."
Double Bottom,"A double bottom pattern is a technical analysis charting pattern that describes a change in trend and a momentum reversal from prior leading price action. It describes the drop of a stock or index, a rebound, another drop to the same or similar level as the original drop, and finally another rebound. The double bottom looks like the letter ""W"". The twice-touched low is considered a support level."
Double Declining Balance Depreciation Method (DDB),"The double declining balance depreciation (DDB) method, also known as the reducing balance method, is one of two common methods a business uses to account for the expense of a long-lived asset. The double declining balance depreciation method is an accelerated depreciation method that counts as an expense more rapidly (when compared to straight-line depreciation that uses the same amount of depreciation each year over an asset's useful life). Similarly, compared to the standard declining balance method, the double declining method depreciates assets twice as quickly."
Double Entry,"Double entry, a fundamental concept underlying present-day bookkeeping and accounting, states that every financial transaction has equal and opposite effects in at least two different accounts. It is used to satisfy the accounting equation:"
Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA),"The double exponential moving average (DEMA) is a technical indicator introduced by Patrick Mulloy in his January 1994 article ""Smoothing Data With Faster Moving Averages"" in Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities magazine. The purpose is to reduce the amount of noise present in price charts used by technical traders."
Double Irish With A Dutch Sandwich,"The double Irish with a Dutch sandwich is a tax avoidance technique employed by certain large corporations, involving the use of a combination of Irish and Dutch subsidiary companies to shift profits to low or no-tax jurisdictions. The technique has made it possible for certain corporations to reduce their overall corporate tax rates dramatically."
Double-Spending,Double-spending is the risk that a digital currency can be spent twice. It is a potential problem unique to digital currencies because digital information can be reproduced relatively easily by savvy individuals who understand the blockchain network and the computing power necessary to manipulate it.
Double Taxation,Double taxation is a tax principle referring to income taxes paid twice on the same source of income. It can occur when income is taxed at both the corporate level and personal level. Double taxation also occurs in international trade or investment when the same income is taxed in two different countries. It can happen with 401k loans.
Double Top,A double top is an extremely bearish technical reversal pattern that forms after an asset reaches a high price two consecutive times with a moderate decline between the two highs. It is confirmed once the asset's price falls below a support level equal to the low between the two prior highs.
Dove,"A dove is an economic policy advisor who promotes monetary policies that usually involve low-interest rates. Doves tend to support low-interest rates and an expansionary monetary policy because they value indicators like low unemployment over keeping inflation low. If an economist suggests that inflation has few negative effects or calls for quantitative easing, then they are called a dove or labeled as dovish."
Dow 30,"The Dow 30, commonly referred to as the ""Dow,"" or the ""Dow Jones Industrial Average,"" was created by Wall Street Journal editor Charles Dow and got its name from Dow and his business partner, Edward Jones.﻿﻿"
Dow Jones CDX,"The credit default swap index (CDX), formerly the Dow Jones CDX, is a benchmark financial instrument made up of credit default swaps (CDS) that have been issued by North American or emerging market companies. The CDX was the first CDS index, which was created in the early 2000s and was based on a basket of single issuer CDSs."
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA),"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), also known as the Dow 30, is a stock market index that tracks 30 large, publicly-owned blue-chip companies trading on the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ. The Dow Jones is named after Charles Dow, who created the index in 1896 along with his business partner Edward Jones."
Dow Theory,"The Dow theory is a financial theory that says the market is in an upward trend if one of its averages (i.e. industrials or transportation) advances above a previous important high and is accompanied or followed by a similar advance in the other average. For example, if the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) climbs to an intermediate high, the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJTA) is expected to follow suit within a reasonable period of time."
Down Payment,"A down payment is a type of payment, often in cash, made in the early stages of a purchase of an expensive good or service. The payment represents a percentage of the full purchase price. In some cases, the down payment is not refundable if the deal falls through because of the purchaser. In most cases, the purchaser makes financing arrangements to cover the remaining amount owed to the seller."
Down Round,A down round refers to a private company offering additional shares for sale at a lower price than had been sold for in the previous financing round.
Downside Risk,"Downside risk is an estimation of a security's potential loss in value if market conditions precipitate a decline in that security's price. Depending on the measure used, downside risk explains a worst-case scenario for an investment and indicates how much the investor stands to lose. Downside risk measures are considered one-sided tests since the potential for profit is not considered."
What Are Downstream Operations?,"Downstream operations are the processes involved in converting oil and gas into the finished product. These include refining crude oil into gasoline, natural gas liquids, diesel, and a variety of other energy sources. The closer an oil and gas company is to the process of providing consumers with petroleum products, the further downstream the company is said to be."
Downtrend,"A downtrend refers to the price action of a security that moves lower in price as it fluctuates over time. While the price may move intermittently higher or lower, downtrends are characterized by lower peaks and lower troughs over time. Technical analysts pay attention to downtrends because they represent something more than a random losing streak. Securities in a downtrend seem to be more likely to continue trending lower until some market condition changes, implying that a downtrend marks a fundamentally deteriorating condition."
Drag-Along Rights,"A drag-along right is a provision or clause in an agreement that enables a majority shareholder to force a minority shareholder to join in the sale of a company. The majority owner doing the dragging must give the minority shareholder the same price, terms, and conditions as any other seller."
Dragonfly Doji Candlestick,"A Dragonfly Doji is a type of candlestick pattern that can signal a potential reversal in price to the downside or upside, depending on past price action. It's formed when the asset's high, open, and close prices are the same. The long lower shadow suggests that there was aggressive selling during the period of the candle, but since the price closed near the open it shows that buyers were able to absorb the selling and push the price back up."
Drawdown,"A drawdown is a peak-to-trough decline during a specific period for an investment, trading account, or fund. A drawdown is usually quoted as the percentage between the peak and the subsequent trough. If a trading account has $10,000 in it, and the funds drop to $9,000 before moving back above $10,000, then the trading account witnessed a 10% drawdown."
Drawee,"Drawee is a legal and banking term used to describe the party that has been directed by the depositor to pay a certain sum of money to the person presenting the check or draft.

Owner withdrawals from businesses that are taxed as separate entities must generally be accounted for as either compensation or dividends.
Dry Powder,"Dry powder is a slang term referring to marketable securities that are highly liquid and considered cash-like. Dry powder can also refer to cash reserves kept on hand by a company, venture capital firm or individual to cover future obligations, purchase assets or make acquisitions. Securities considered to be dry powder could be Treasuries or other short-term fixed income investment that can be liquidated on short notice in order to provide emergency funding or allow an investor to purchase assets."
Dual Class Stock,"A dual class stock is when a company issues two share classes. A dual class stock structure can consist of Class A and Class B shares, for example. These shares can differ in terms of voting rights and dividend payments."
"Dual Income, No Kids (DINK)","Dual income, no kids (DINK) is a slang phrase for a household in which there are two incomes and no children. Couples living in a DINK household frequently have more disposable income because they do not have the added expenses that come with children. They also often spend less per person on housing than singles because of their ability to share kitchens, bathrooms, and living rooms."
Dual Listing,"Dual listing refers to a listing of any security on two or more different exchanges. Companies use dual listing because of its benefits such as additional liquidity, increased access to capital, and the ability for its shares to trade for longer periods if the exchanges on which its shares are listed are in different time zones outweigh the costs of a second listing. Some exchanges have a number of listing categories for companies that seek a dual listing, each with different requirements and benefits."
Due from Account,A due from account is an asset account in the general ledger used to track money owed to a company that is currently being held at another firm. It is typically used in conjunction with a due to account and is sometimes referred to as intercompany receivables.
Due to Account,A due to account is a liability account typically found inside the general ledger that indicates the amount of funds payable to another party. The funds can be currently due or due at a point in the future. This due to account is usually generated and put on the books as the result of a transaction.
Due Diligence,"Due diligence is an investigation, audit, or review performed to confirm facts or details of a matter under consideration. In the financial world, due diligence requires an examination of financial records before entering into a proposed transaction with another party."
Dumping,"Dumping is a term used in the context of international trade. It's when a country or company exports a product at a price that is lower in the foreign importing market than the price in the exporter's domestic market. Because dumping typically involves substantial export volumes of a product, it often endangers the financial viability of the product's manufacturer or producer in the importing nation."
Dun & Bradstreet (D&B),"Dun & Bradstreet is a corporation that offers information on commercial credit as well as reports on businesses. Most notably, Dun & Bradstreet is recognizable for its Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS numbers); these generate business information reports for more than 100 million companies around the globe. Dun & Bradstreet was established as the result of a merger in the 1930s between R.G. Dun & Co. and the Bradstreet Cos."
DuPont Analysis,The DuPont analysis (also known as the DuPont identity or DuPont model) is a framework for analyzing fundamental performance popularized by the DuPont Corporation. DuPont analysis is a useful technique used to decompose the different drivers of return on equity (ROE). The decomposition of ROE allows investors to focus on the key metrics of financial performance individually to identify strengths and weaknesses.
Durable Goods Orders,Durable goods orders is a broad-based monthly survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau that measures current industrial activity and is used as an economic indicator by investors.
Durbin Watson Statistic,The Durbin Watson (DW) statistic is a test for autocorrelation in the residuals from a statistical regression analysis. The Durbin-Watson statistic will always have a value between 0 and 4. A value of 2.0 means that there is no autocorrelation detected in the sample. Values from 0 to less than 2 indicate positive autocorrelation and values from from 2 to 4 indicate negative autocorrelation.
Dutch Auction,"A Dutch auction is a market structure in which the price of something offered is determined after taking in all bids to arrive at the highest price at which the total offering can be sold. In this type of auction, investors place a bid for the amount they are willing to buy in terms of quantity and price."
Dutch Disease,Dutch disease is an economic term for the negative consequences that can arise from a spike in the value of a nation’s currency. It is primarily associated with the new discovery or exploitation of a valuable natural resource and the unexpected repercussions that such a discovery can have on the overall economy of a nation.
Dutch Tulip Bulb Market Bubble,"The Dutch tulip bulb market bubble, also known as 'tulipmania' was one of the most famous market bubbles and crashes of all time. It occurred in Holland during the early to mid 1600s when speculation drove the value of tulip bulbs to extremes. At the height of the market, the rarest tulip bulbs traded for as much as six times the average person's annual salary."
Dynasty Trust,"A dynasty trust is a long-term trust created to pass wealth from generation to generation without incurring transfer taxes—such as the gift tax, estate tax, or generation-skipping transfer tax (GSTT)—for as long as assets remain in the trust."
E-Mini,"An E-mini is an electronically traded futures contract that is a fraction of the value of a corresponding standard futures contract. E-minis are predominantly traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and are available on a wide range of indexes, such as the NASDAQ 100, S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and Russell 2000, commodities, and currencies."
EAFE Index,"The EAFE Index is a stock index offered by MSCI that covers non-U.S. and Canadian equity markets. It serves as a performance benchmark for the major international equity markets as represented by 21 major MSCI indices from Europe, Australasia, and the Middle East."
Early Adopter,"The term ""early adopter"" refers to an individual or business who uses a new product, innovation, or technology before others. An early adopter is likely to pay more for the product than later adopters but accepts this premium if using the product improves efficiency, reduces cost, increases market penetration, or raises the early adopter's social status."
Earmarking,"Earmarking is the practice of setting particular money aside for a specific purpose. The term can be used in several contexts, such as in congressional appropriations of taxpayer funds to individual practices like mental accounting."
Earned Income,"Earned income includes money made from employment including wages, salaries, bonuses, commissions, tips, and net earnings from self-employment, according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) definition. It can also include long-term disability and union strike benefits and, in some cases, payments from certain deferred retirement compensation arrangements."
Earned Income Credit (EIC),"The earned-income credit (EIC) is a refundable tax credit that helps certain U.S. taxpayers with low earnings by reducing the amount of tax owed on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Taxpayers may be eligible for refunds if their tax credit exceeds their tax liability for the year. Legislation enacted in 2020 recognized that many taxpayers’ incomes that year were lower than their incomes in 2019 due to the COVID pandemic; this law allows taxpayers to base the EIC claimed on their 2020 tax returns on either their 2019 or 2020 earnings. For 2021 tax returns, the law liberalizes some EIC rules and makes an increased EIC available to more childless taxpayers."
Earned Premium,"The term earned premium refers to the premium collected by an insurance company for the portion of a policy that has expired. It is what the insured party has paid for a portion of time in which the insurance policy was in effect, but has since expired. Since the insurance company covers the risk during that time, it considers the associated premium payments it takes from the insured party as unearned. Once the time has expired, it can then record it as earned or as a profit."
Earnest Money,"Earnest money is a deposit made to a seller that represents a buyer's good faith to buy a home. The money gives the buyer extra time to get financing and conduct the title search, property appraisal, and inspections before closing. In many ways, earnest money can be considered a deposit on a home, an escrow deposit, or good faith money."
Earnings,A company's earnings are its after-tax net income. This is the company's bottom line or its profits.
Earnings Announcement,"An earnings announcement is an official public statement of a company's profitability for a specific period, typically a quarter or a year. An earnings announcement occurs on a specific date during earnings season and is preceded by earnings estimates issued by equity analysts. If a company has been profitable leading up to the announcement, its share price will usually increase up to and slightly after the information is released. Because earnings announcements can have such a prominent effect on the market, they are often considered when predicting the next day's open."
Earnings Before Interest After Taxes (EBIAT),Earnings before interest after taxes (EBIAT) is one of a number of financial measures that are used to evaluate a company's operating performance for a quarter or a year.
Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT),"Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is an indicator of a company's profitability. EBIT can be calculated as revenue minus expenses excluding tax and interest. EBIT is also referred to as operating earnings, operating profit, and profit before interest and taxes."
"Earnings Before Interest, Depreciation and Amortization (EBIDA)","Earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization (EBIDA) is a measure of the earnings of a company that adds the interest expense, depreciation, and amortization back to the net income number. However, it does include tax expenses. This measure is not as well known or used as often as its counterpart—earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)."
"Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA)","EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, is a measure of a company's overall financial performance and is used as an alternative to net income in some circumstances. EBITDA, however, can be misleading because it strips out the cost of capital investments like property, plant, and equipment."
Earnings Call,"An earnings call is a conference call between the management of a public company, analysts, investors, and the media to discuss the company’s financial results during a given reporting period, such as a quarter or a fiscal year. An earnings call is usually preceded by an earnings report, which contains summary information on financial performance for the period."
Earnings Credit Rate (ECR),The earnings credit rate (ECR) is a daily calculation of interest that a bank pays on customer deposits. The earnings credit rate is often correlated with the U.S. Treasury bill (T-bill) rate.
Earnings Estimate,"An earnings estimate is an analyst's estimate for a company's future quarterly or annual earnings per share (EPS). Future earnings estimates are arguably the most important input when attempting to value a firm. By placing estimates on the earnings of a firm for certain periods (quarterly, annually, etc.), analysts can then use cash flow analysis to approximate fair value for a company, which in turn will give a target share price."
Earnings Management,"Earnings management is the use of accounting techniques to produce financial statements that present an overly positive view of a company's business activities and financial position. Many accounting rules and principles require that a company's management make judgments in following these principles. Earnings management takes advantage of how accounting rules are applied and creates financial statements that inflate or ""smooth"" earnings."
Earnings Multiplier,"The earnings multiplier is a financial metric that frames a company's current stock price in terms of the company's earnings per share (EPS) of stock, that's simply computed as price per share/earnings per share. Also known as the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, the earnings multiplier can be used as a simplified valuation tool with which to compare the relative costliness of the stocks of similar companies. It can likewise help investors judge current stock prices against their historical prices on an earnings-relative basis."
Earnings Per Share (EPS),Earnings per share (EPS) is calculated as a company's profit divided by the outstanding shares of its common stock. The resulting number serves as an indicator of a company's profitability. It is common for a company to report EPS that is adjusted for extraordinary items and potential share dilution.
Earnings Power Value,Earnings power value (EPV) is a technique for valuing stocks by making assumptions about the sustainability of current earnings and the cost of capital but not future growth. Earnings power value (EPV) is derived by dividing a company's adjusted earnings by its weighted average cost of capital (WACC).
Earnings Report,"A quarterly earnings report is a quarterly filing made by public companies to report their performance. Earnings reports include items such as net income, earnings per share, earnings from continuing operations, and net sales. By analyzing quarterly earnings reports, investors can begin to gauge the financial health of the company and determine whether it deserves their investment."
Earnings Yield,The earnings yield refers to the earnings per share for the most recent 12-month period divided by the current market price per share. The earnings yield (which is the inverse of the P/E ratio) shows the percentage of a company's earnings per share. This metric is used by many investment managers to determine optimal asset allocations and is used by investors to determine which assets seem underpriced or overpriced.
Earnout,"An earnout is a contractual provision stating that the seller of a business is to obtain additional compensation in the future if the business achieves certain financial goals, which are usually stated as a percentage of gross sales or earnings."
Easement In Gross,"An easement in gross is an easement that attaches a particular right to an individual or entity rather than to the property itself. The easement in gross is often considered irrevocable for the life of the individual, but it can be rendered void if the individual sells the property upon which the easement request was based."
Eavesdropping Attack,"An eavesdropping attack, also known as a sniffing or snooping attack, is a theft of information as it is transmitted over a network by a computer, smartphone, or another connected device."
EBIT/EV Multiple Definition,"The EBIT/EV multiple, shorthand for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) divided by enterprise value (EV), is a financial ratio used to measure a company's ""earnings yield."""
EBITA,"Earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA) is a measure of company profitability used by investors. It is helpful for comparison of one company to another in the same line of business. In some cases, it also can provide a more accurate view of the company's real performance over time."
EBITDA Margin,"The EBITDA margin is a measure of a company's operating profit as a percentage of its revenue. The acronym EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Knowing the EBITDA margin allows for a comparison of one company's real performance to others in its industry."
EBITDA/EV Multiple,"The EBITDA/EV multiple is a financial valuation ratio that measures a company's return on investment (ROI). The EBITDA/EV ratio may be preferred over other measures of return because it is normalized for differences between companies. Using EBITDA normalizes for differences in capital structure, taxation, and fixed asset accounting. The enterprise value (EV) also normalizes for differences in a company's capital structure."
EBITDA-to-Interest Coverage Ratio,"The EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio is a financial ratio that is used to assess a company's financial durability by examining whether it is at least profitable enough to pay off its interest expenses using its pre-tax income. Specifically it looks to see what proportion of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), can be used for this purpose."
EBITDA-to-Sales Ratio,"The EBITDA-to-sales ratio, also known as EBITDA margin, is a financial metric used to assess a company's profitability by comparing its gross revenue with its earnings. More specifically, since EBITDA itself is derived in part from revenue, this metric indicates the percentage of a company's earnings remaining after operating expenses. A higher value indicates the company is able to produce earnings more efficiently by keeping costs low."
EBITDAR,"Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and restructuring or rent costs (EBITDAR) is a non-GAAP tool used to measure a company's financial performance. Although EBITDAR does not appear on a company's income statement, it can be calculated using information from the income statement."
eCash,"eCash was a digital-based system that facilitated the transfer of funds anonymously. A pioneer in cryptocurrency, its goal was to secure the privacy of individuals that use the Internet for micropayments. eCash was created by Dr. David Chaum under his company, DigiCash, in 1990. Though there was interest in the platform from large banks, eCash never took off and DigiCash filed for bankruptcy in 1998. DigiCash, along with its eCash patents, was eventually sold off. In 2018, Chaum launched a new startup focused on cryptography."
Eclectic Paradigms,"An eclectic paradigm, also known as the ownership, location, internalization (OLI) model or OLI framework, is a three-tiered evaluation framework that companies can follow when attempting to determine if it is beneficial to pursue foreign direct investment (FDI). This paradigm assumes that institutions will avoid transactions in the open market if the cost of completing the same actions internally, or in-house, carries a lower price. It is based on internalization theory and was first expounded upon in 1979 by the scholar John H. Dunning."
ECN Broker,"An ECN broker is a financial intermediary that uses electronic communications networks (ECNs) to give clients direct access to other participants in equity and currency markets. Because an ECN broker consolidates price quotations from several market participants, it can generally offer its clients tighter bid/ask spreads than would be otherwise available to them."
Economic Calendar,"The economic calendar refers to the scheduled dates of significant releases or events that may affect movement of individual security prices or markets as a whole. Investors and traders use the economic calendar to plan trades and portfolio reallocations, as well as to be alert to chart patterns and indicators that may be caused or affected by these events. The economic calendar for various countries is available for free on multiple financial and market websites."
Economic Capital,"Economic capital is a measure of risk in terms of capital. More specifically, it's the amount of capital that a company (usually in financial services) needs to ensure that it stays solvent given its risk profile."
Economic Collapse,"An economic collapse is a breakdown of a national, regional, or territorial economy that typically follows a time of crisis. An economic collapse occurs at the onset of a severe version of an economic contraction, depression, or recession and can last any number of years depending on the severity of the circumstances. An economic collapse can happen rapidly due to an unexpected event, or it may be preceded by several events or signs pointing to fragility in the economy."
Economic Conditions,"Economic conditions refer to the present state of the economy in a country or region. These conditions change over time along with the economic and business cycles, as an economy goes through periods of expansion and contraction. Economic conditions are considered to be sound or positive when an economy is expanding and are seen as adverse or negative when an economy is contracting."
Economic Cycle,"The economic cycle is the fluctuation of the economy between periods of expansion (growth) and contraction (recession). Factors such as gross domestic product (GDP), interest rates, total employment, and consumer spending, can help to determine the current stage of the economic cycle."
Economic Depreciation,"Economic depreciation is a measure of the decrease in the market value of an asset over time from influential economic factors. This form of depreciation usually pertains to real estate, which can lose value for several reasons such as the addition of unfavorable construction in close proximity to a property, road closures, a decline in the quality of a neighborhood, or other negative influences."
Economic Efficiency,Economic efficiency is when all goods and factors of production in an economy are distributed or allocated to their most valuable uses and waste is eliminated or minimized.
Economic Equilibrium,"Economic equilibrium is a condition or state in which economic forces are balanced. In effect, economic variables remain unchanged from their equilibrium values in the absence of external influences. Economic equilibrium is also referred to as market equilibrium."
Economic Exposure,"Economic exposure is a type of foreign exchange exposure caused by the effect of unexpected currency fluctuations on a company’s future cash flows, foreign investments, and earnings. Economic exposure, also known as operating exposure, can have a substantial impact on a company’s market value since it has far-reaching effects and is long-term in nature. Companies can hedge against unexpected currency fluctuations by investing in foreign exchange (FX) trading."
Economic Forecasting,Economic forecasting is the process of attempting to predict the future condition of the economy using a combination of important and widely followed indicators.
Economic Growth,"Economic growth is an increase in the production of economic goods and services, compared from one period of time to another. It can be measured in nominal or real (adjusted for inflation) terms. Traditionally, aggregate economic growth is measured in terms of gross national product (GNP) or gross domestic product (GDP), although alternative metrics are sometimes used."
Economic Growth Rate,"An economic growth rate is the percentage change in the value of all of the goods and services produced in a nation during a specific period of time, as compared to an earlier period. The economic growth rate is used to measure the comparative health of an economy over time. The numbers are usually compiled and reported quarterly and annually."
Economic Indicator,"An economic indicator is a piece of economic data, usually of macroeconomic scale, that is used by analysts to interpret current or future investment possibilities. These indicators also help to judge the overall health of an economy."
Economic Integration,Economic integration is an arrangement among nations that typically includes the reduction or elimination of trade barriers and the coordination of monetary and fiscal policies. Economic integration aims to reduce costs for both consumers and producers and to increase trade between the countries involved in the agreement.
Economic Justice,"Economic justice is a component of social justice and welfare economics. It is a set of moral and ethical principles for building economic institutions, where the ultimate goal is to create an opportunity for each person to establish a sufficient material foundation upon which to have a dignified, productive, and creative life."
Economic Life,"Economic life is the expected period of time during which an asset remains useful to the average owner. When an asset is no longer useful to its owner, then it is said to be past its economic life. The economic life of an asset could be different than its actual physical life. Thus, an asset can be in optimal physical condition but may not be economically useful. For example, technology products often become obsolete when their technology becomes obsolete. The obsolescence of flip phones occurred due to the advent of smartphones and not because they ran out of utility."
Economic Moat,"Conceptualized and named by Warren Buffett, an economic moat is a distinct advantage a company has over its competitors which allows it to protect its market share and profitability. It is often an advantage that is difficult to mimic or duplicate (brand identity, patents) and thus creates an effective barrier against competition from other firms."
Economic Order Quantity (EOQ),"Economic order quantity (EOQ) is the ideal order quantity a company should purchase to minimize inventory costs such as holding costs, shortage costs, and order costs. This production-scheduling model was developed in 1913 by Ford W. Harris and has been refined over time. The formula assumes that demand, ordering, and holding costs all remain constant."
Economic Profit (or Loss),"An economic profit or loss is the difference between the revenue received from the sale of an output and the costs of all inputs used, as well as any opportunity costs. In calculating economic profit, opportunity costs and explicit costs are deducted from revenues earned."
Economic Recovery,"Economic recovery is the business cycle stage following a recession that is characterized by a sustained period of improving business activity. Normally, during an economic recovery, gross domestic product (GDP) grows, incomes rise, and unemployment falls and as the economy rebounds."
Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA),"The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA) was the largest tax cut in U.S. history. Signed by President Ronald Reagan about six months after he took office, ERTA slashed the top income tax rate and allowed for faster expensing of depreciable assets. It included incentives for small business and retirement savings, and established inflation indexing of tax brackets."
Economic Rent,"Economic rent is an amount of money earned that exceeds that which is economically or socially necessary. This can occur, for example, when a buyer working to attain a good or service that is considered exclusive makes an offer prior to hearing what a seller considers an acceptable price. Market imperfections thus lead to the rise of economic rents; it would not exist if markets were perfect since competitive pressures would drive down prices."
Economic Shock,"An economic shock refers to any change to fundamental macroeconomic variables or relationships that has a substantial effect on macroeconomic outcomes and measures of economic performance, such as unemployment, consumption, and inflation. Shocks are often unpredictable and are usually the result of events thought to be beyond the scope of normal economic transactions."
Economic Stimulus,"Economic stimulus is action by the government to encourage private sector economic activity by engaging in targeted, expansionary monetary or fiscal policy based on the ideas of Keynesian economics. The term economic stimulus is based on an analogy to the biological process of stimulus and response, with the intention of using government policy as a stimulus to elicit a response from the private sector economy."
Economic Value,"Economic value is the value that person places on an economic good based on the benefit that they derive from the good. It is often estimated based on the person’s willingness to pay for the good, typically measured in units of currency. The economic value should not be confused with market value, which is the market price for a good or service which can be higher or lower than the economic value that any particular person puts on a good."
Economic Value Added (EVA),"Economic value added (EVA) is a measure of a company's financial performance based on the residual wealth calculated by deducting its cost of capital from its operating profit, adjusted for taxes on a cash basis. EVA can also be referred to as economic profit, as it attempts to capture the true economic profit of a company. This measure was devised by management consulting firm Stern Value Management, originally incorporated as Stern Stewart & Co.﻿﻿"
Economic Value of Equity (EVE),"The economic value of equity (EVE) is a cash flow calculation that takes the present value of all asset cash flows and subtracts the present value of all liability cash flows. Unlike earnings at risk and value at risk (VAR), a bank uses the economic value of equity to manage its assets and liabilities. This is a long-term economic measure used to assess the degree of interest rate risk exposure—as opposed to net-interest income (NII), which reflects short-term interest rate risk."
Economies of Scale,Economies of scale are cost advantages reaped by companies when production becomes efficient. Companies can achieve economies of scale by increasing production and lowering costs. This happens because costs are spread over a larger number of goods. Costs can be both fixed and variable.
Economies of Scope,"An economy of scope means that the production of one good reduces the cost of producing another related good. Economies of scope occur when producing a wider variety of goods or services in tandem is more cost effective for a firm than producing less of a variety, or producing each good independently. In such a case, the long-run average and marginal cost of a company, organization, or economy decreases due to the production of complementary goods and services."
Economist,"An economist is an expert who studies the relationship between a society's resources and its production or output. Economists study societies ranging from small, local communities to entire nations and even the global economy."
Economy,"An economy is the large set of inter-related production, consumption, and exchange activities that aid in determining how scarce resources are allocated. The production, consumption, and distribution of goods and services are used to fulfill the needs of those living and operating within the economy, which is also referred to as an economic system."
EdTech,"EdTech (a combination of ""education"" and ""technology"") refers to hardware and software designed to enhance teacher-led learning in classrooms and improve students' education outcomes."
Education Loan,"An education loan is a sum of money borrowed to finance post-secondary education or higher education-related expenses. Education loans are intended to cover the cost of tuition, books and supplies, and living expenses while the borrower is in the process of pursuing a degree. Payments are often deferred while students are in college and, depending on the lender, sometimes they are deferred for an additional six-month period after earning a degree. This period is sometimes referred to as a ""grace period."""
Education IRA,"An education IRA is a tax-advantaged investment account for higher education, now more formally known as a Coverdell Education Savings Account (ESA). Under this educational savings vehicle, parents and guardians are allowed to make nondeductible contributions to an education individual retirement account (IRA) for a child under the age of 18."
Effective Annual Interest Rate,"The effective annual interest rate is the real return on a savings account or any interest-paying investment when the effects of compounding over time are taken into account. It also reveals the real percentage rate owed in interest on a loan, a credit card, or any other debt."
Effective Dates,"In contract law, the effective date is the date that an agreement or transaction between or among signatories becomes binding. For an initial public offering (IPO), it is the date when shares can first be traded on an exchange."
Effective Duration,"Effective duration is a duration calculation for bonds that have embedded options. This measure of duration takes into account the fact that expected cash flows will fluctuate as interest rates change and is, therefore, a measure of risk. Effective duration can be estimated using modified duration if a bond with embedded options behaves like an option-free bond."
Effective Gross Income (EGI),Effective gross income (EGI) is the Potential Gross Rental Income plus other income minus vacancy and credit costs of a rental property.
Effective Interest Method Definition,"The effective interest method is an accounting standard used to amortize, or discount a bond. This method is used for bonds sold at a discount, where the amount of the bond discount is amortized to interest expense over the bond's life."
Effective Tax Rate,"The effective tax rate is the percent of their income that an individual or a corporation pays in taxes. The effective tax rate for individuals is the average rate at which their earned income, such as wages, and unearned income, such as stock dividends, are taxed. The effective tax rate for a corporation is the average rate at which its pre-tax profits are taxed, while the statutory tax rate is the legal percentage established by law."
Effective Yield,"The effective yield is the return on a bond that has its interest payments (or coupons) reinvested at the same rate by the bondholder. Effective yield is the total yield an investor receives, in contrast to the nominal yield—which is the stated interest rate of the bond's coupon. Effective yield takes into account the power of compounding on investment returns, while nominal yield does not."
Efficiency Ratio,"The efficiency ratio is typically used to analyze how well a company uses its assets and liabilities internally. An efficiency ratio can calculate the turnover of receivables, the repayment of liabilities, the quantity and usage of equity, and the general use of inventory and machinery. This ratio can also be used to track and analyze the performance of commercial and investment banks."
Efficient Frontier,The efficient frontier is the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return. Portfolios that lie below the efficient frontier are sub-optimal because they do not provide enough return for the level of risk. Portfolios that cluster to the right of the efficient frontier are sub-optimal because they have a higher level of risk for the defined rate of return.
Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH),"The efficient market hypothesis (EMH), alternatively known as the efficient market theory, is a hypothesis that states that share prices reflect all information and consistent alpha generation is impossible."
What Is Egalitarianism?,"Egalitarianism is a philosophical perspective that emphasizes equality and equal treatment across gender, religion, economic status, and political beliefs. Egalitarianism may focus on income inequality and distribution, which are ideas that influenced the development of various economic and political systems. Egalitarianism also looks at how individuals are treated under the law. Karl Marx used egalitarianism as the starting point in the creation of his Marxist philosophy, and John Locke considered egalitarianism when he proposed that individuals had natural rights."
Elastic,"Elastic is a term used in economics to describe a change in the behavior of buyers and sellers in response to a change in price for a good or service. In other words, demand elasticity or inelasticity for a product or good is determined by how much demand for the product changes as the price increases or decreases. An inelastic product is one that consumers continue to purchase even after a change in price. The elasticity of a good or service can vary according to the number of close substitutes available, its relative cost, and the amount of time that has elapsed since the price change occurred."
Elective-Deferral Contribution,An elective-deferral contribution is made directly from an employee's salary to his or her employer-sponsored retirement plan such as a 401(k) or 403(b) plan. The employee must authorize the transaction before the contribution can be deducted.
Electronic Bill Payment and Presentment (EBPP),"Electronic bill payment and presentment (EBPP) is a process that companies use to collect payments electronically through systems like the Internet, direct-dial access, and Automated Teller Machines (ATMs). It has become a core component of online banking at many financial institutions today. Other industries—including insurance providers, telecommunications companies, and utilities—depend on EBPP services as well."
Electronic Check,"An electronic check, or e-check, is a form of payment made via the Internet, or another data network, designed to perform the same function as a conventional paper check. Since the check is in an electronic format, it can be processed in fewer steps."
Electronic Commerce (e-commerce),Electronic commerce or e-commerce (sometimes written as eCommerce) is a business model that lets firms and individuals buy and sell things over the internet. E-commerce operates in all four of the following major market segments:
Electronic Communication Network,An electronic communication network (ECN) is a computerized system that automatically matches buy and sell orders for securities in the market. ECN trading is especially helpful when investors in different geographic areas wish to complete a secure transaction without the use of a third party.
"Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR)","EDGAR — Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval — is the electronic filing system created by the Securities and Exchange Commission to increase the efficiency and accessibility of corporate filings. The system is used by all publicly traded companies when submitting required documents to the SEC. Corporate documents are time-sensitive, and the creation of EDGAR has greatly decreased the time it takes for corporate documents to become publicly available."

Equal Weight,"Equal weight is a type of weighting that gives the same weight, or importance, to each stock in a portfolio or index fund, and the smallest companies are given equal weight to the largest companies in an equal-weight index fund or portfolio. Equal weighting differs from the weighting method more commonly used by funds and portfolios in which stocks are weighted based on their market capitalizations. Equal-weighted index funds tend to have higher stock turnover than market-cap weighted index funds, and as a result, they usually have higher trading costs."
Equated Monthly Installment (EMI),"An equated monthly installment (EMI) is a fixed payment amount made by a borrower to a lender at a specified date each calendar month. Equated monthly installments are applied to both interest and principal each month so that over a specified number of years, the loan is paid off in full. In the most common types of loans—such as real estate mortgages, auto loans, and student loans—the borrower makes fixed periodic payments to the lender over the course of several years with the goal of retiring the loan."
Equation of Exchange,"The equation of exchange is an economic identity that shows the relationship between money supply, the velocity of money, the price level, and an index of expenditures. English classical economist John Stuart Mill derived the equation of exchange, based on earlier ideas of David Hume. It says that the total amount of money that changes hands in the economy will always equal the total money value of the goods and services that change hands in the economy."
Equilibrium Quantity,"Equilibrium quantity is when there is no shortage or surplus of a product in the market. Supply and demand intersect, meaning the amount of an item that consumers want to buy is equal to the amount being supplied by its producers.

Equity Derivative,"An equity derivative is a financial instrument whose value is based on equity movements of the underlying asset. For example, a stock option is an equity derivative, because its value is based on the price movements of the underlying stock. Investors can use equity derivatives to hedge the risk associated with taking long or short positions in stocks, or they can use them to speculate on the price movements of the underlying asset."
Equity-Efficiency Tradeoff,"An equity-efficiency tradeoff is when there is some kind of conflict between maximizing economic efficiency and maximizing the equity (or fairness) of society in some way. When and if such a trade-off exists, economists or public policymakers may decide to sacrifice some amount of economic efficiency for the sake of achieving a more just or equitable society."

Equity Fund,An equity fund is a mutual fund that invests principally in stocks. It can be actively or passively (index fund) managed. Equity funds are also known as stock funds.
Equity-Linked Note (ELN),"An equity-linked note (ELN) is an investment product that combines a fixed-income investment with additional potential returns that are tied to the performance of equities. Equity-linked notes are usually structured to return the initial investment with a variable interest portion that depends on the performance of the linked equity. ELNs can be structured in many different ways, but the vanilla version works like a strip bond combined with a call option on a specific security, a basket of securities or an index like the S&P 500 or DJIA. In the case of a note linked to an equity index, the security would typically be called an equity index-linked note."
Equity-Linked Security (ELKS),"The term equity-linked security refers to a debt instrument with variable payments linked to an equity market benchmark. These securities are an alternative type of fixed-income investment—structured products most often created as bonds.

Equity Premium Puzzle (EPP),"The equity premium puzzle (EPP) refers to the excessively high historical outperformance of stocks over Treasury bills, which is difficult to explain. The equity risk premium, which is usually defined as equity returns minus the return of Treasury bills, is estimated to be between 5% and 8% in the United States. The premium is supposed to reflect the relative risk of stocks compared to ""risk-free"" government securities. However, the puzzle arises because this unexpectedly large percentage implies an unreasonably high level of risk aversion among investors."
Equity Risk Premium,The term equity risk premium refers to an excess return that investing in the stock market provides over a risk-free rate. This excess return compensates investors for taking on the relatively higher risk of equity investing. The size of the premium varies and depends on the level of risk in a particular portfolio. It also changes over time as market risk fluctuates.
Equivalent Annual Annuity Approach (EAA),"The equivalent annual annuity approach is one of two methods used in capital budgeting to compare mutually exclusive projects with unequal lives. The EAA approach calculates the constant annual cash flow generated by a project over its lifespan if it was an annuity. When used to compare projects with unequal lives, an investor should choose the one with the higher EAA."
Equivalent Annual Cost (EAC),"Equivalent annual cost (EAC) is the annual cost of owning, operating, and maintaining an asset over its entire life. Firms often use EAC for capital budgeting decisions, as it allows a company to compare the cost-effectiveness of various assets with unequal lifespans."
Erosion,"Erosion can include any negative impact on a company’s associated assets or funds. Erosion can be experienced with regard to profits, sales, or tangible assets, such as manufacturing equipment. Erosion is often considered a general risk factor within an organization’s cash management system, as the losses may be slow and occurring over time."
Error Term,"An error term is a residual variable produced by a statistical or mathematical model, which is created when the model does not fully represent the actual relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variables. As a result of this incomplete relationship, the error term is the amount at which the equation may differ during empirical analysis."
Errors and Omissions Insurance (E&O),"Errors and omissions insurance (E&O) is a type of professional liability insurance that protects companies, their workers, and other professionals against claims of inadequate work or negligent actions."
Escheat,Escheat refers to the right of a government to take ownership of estate assets or unclaimed property. It most commonly occurs when an individual dies with no will and no heirs. Escheat rights can also be granted when assets are unclaimed for a prolonged period of time. These situations can also be referred to as bona vacantia or simply just unclaimed property.
Escrow,"Escrow is a legal concept describing a financial instrument whereby an asset or escrow money is held by a third party on behalf of two other parties that are in the process of completing a transaction.

Money, securities, funds, and other assets can all be held in escrow. It is often suggested as a replacement for a certified or cashier's check."
Escrow Agent,An escrow agent is a person or entity that holds property in trust for third parties while a transaction is finalized or a disagreement is resolved. The role of escrow agent is often played by an attorney (or notary in civil law jurisdictions). The escrow agent has a fiduciary responsibility to both parties of the escrow agreement.
Escrow Agreement,"An escrow agreement is a contract that outlines the terms and conditions between parties involved, and the responsibility of each. Escrow agreements generally involve an independent third party, called an escrow agent, who holds an asset of value until the specified conditions of the contract are met. However, they should fully outline the conditions for all parties involved."
Escrowed Shares,"Escrowed shares are shares held in an escrow account, secured by a third party, pending the completion of a corporate action or an elapse of time leading up to an event. Shares are escrowed in three common cases: merger and acquisition transactions; bankruptcy or reorganization of a company; and granting of restricted shares to an employee of a firm."
Esoteric Debt,"Esoteric debt refers to debt instruments as well as other investments (called esoteric assets) that are structured in a way that few people fully understand. Esoteric debt is complex and can be a product of securitization, or simply arise through a complex financing arrangement. As such, the pricing of these securities can be contested or seem to be known to relatively few market participants. Moreover, the structure of these instruments may lead to deceptively attractive risk/return profiles over other investments when the instruments function properly, but can also lead to illiquidity and pricing problems when markets are disrupted."
Estate,"An estate is everything comprising the net worth of an individual, including all land and real estate, possessions, financial securities, cash, and other assets that the individual owns or has a controlling interest in."
Estate Planning,Estate planning is the preparation of tasks that serve to manage an individual's asset base in the event of their incapacitation or death. The planning includes the bequest of assets to heirs and the settlement of estate taxes. Most estate plans are set up with the help of an attorney experienced in estate law.
Estate Tax,"An estate tax is a levy on estates whose value exceeds an exclusion limit set by law. Only the amount that exceeds that minimum threshold is subject to tax. Assessed by the federal government and about a dozen state governments, these levies are calculated based on the estate's fair market value (FMV) rather than what the deceased originally paid for its assets. The tax is levied by the state in which the deceased person was living at the time of their death."

Ether (ETH),Ether is the transactional token that facilitates operations on the Ethereum network. All of the programs and services linked with the Ethereum network require computing power (and that computing power is not free). Ether is a form of payment for network participants to execute their requested operations on the network.
Ethereum Classic,"Ethereum Classic is an open-source, decentralized, blockchain-based distributed cryptocurrency platform that runs smart contracts. Ethereum Classic was formed—as a result of a hack of the network—in 2016.

Some of the most basic return comparisons include a riskless rate and benchmarks with similar levels of risk to the investment being analyzed.
Exchange,"An exchange is a marketplace where securities, commodities, derivatives and other financial instruments are traded. The core function of an exchange is to ensure fair and orderly trading and the efficient dissemination of price information for any securities trading on that exchange. Exchanges give companies, governments, and other groups a platform from which to sell securities to the investing public."
Exchange Control,"Exchange controls are government-imposed limitations on the purchase and/or sale of currencies. These controls allow countries to better stabilize their economies by limiting in-flows and out-flows of currency, which can create exchange rate volatility.

Exchange Traded Derivative,"An exchange traded derivative is a financial contract that is listed and trades on a regulated exchange. Simply put, these are derivatives that are traded in a regulated fashion. Exchange traded derivatives have become increasingly popular because of the advantages they have over over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, such as standardization, liquidity, and elimination of default risk. Futures and options are two of the most popular exchange traded derivatives. Exchange traded derivatives can be used to hedge exposure or speculate on a wide range of financial assets like commodities, equities, currencies, and even interest rates."
Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF),"An exchange traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that tracks an index, sector, commodity, or other asset, but which can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange the same as a regular stock.

The expected loss ratio (ELR) method is used when an insurer lacks the appropriate past claims occurrence data to provide because of changes to its product offerings and when it lacks a large enough sample of data for long-tail product lines."
Expected Value (EV),"The expected value (EV) is an anticipated value for an investment at some point in the future. In statistics and probability analysis, the expected value is calculated by multiplying each of the possible outcomes by the likelihood each outcome will occur and then summing all of those values. By calculating expected values, investors can choose the scenario most likely to give the desired outcome."
Expected Return,The expected return is the profit or loss that an investor anticipates on an investment that has known historical rates of return (RoR). It is calculated by multiplying potential outcomes by the chances of them occurring and then totaling these results.
Expected Utility,"Expected utility is an economic term summarizing the utility that an entity or aggregate economy is expected to reach under any number of circumstances. The expected utility is calculated by taking the weighted average of all possible outcomes under certain circumstances. With the weights being assigned by the likelihood or probability, any particular event will occur."

It is the most common way to estimate GDP. It says everything that the private sector, including consumers and private firms, and government spend within the borders of a particular country, must add up to the total value of all finished goods and services produced over a certain period of time. This method produces nominal GDP, which must then be adjusted for inflation to result in the real GDP."

However, E&P companies typically do not refine or produce energy but merely find and extract raw materials to be shipped to other oil companies within the production process."
Exponential Growth,"Exponential growth is a pattern of data that shows greater increases with passing time, creating the curve of an exponential function. For example, suppose a population of mice rises exponentially every year starting with two in the first year, then four in the second year, 16 in the third year, 256 in the fourth year, and so on. The population is growing to the power of 2 each year in this case."
Exponential Moving Average (EMA),"An exponential moving average (EMA) is a type of moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points.

Factor Investing,"Factor investing is a strategy that chooses securities on attributes that are associated with higher returns. There are two main types of factors that have driven returns of stocks, bonds, and other factors: macroeconomic factors and style factors. The former captures broad risks across asset classes while the latter aims to explain returns and risks within asset classes."

Fair Market Value (FMV),"In its simplest sense, fair market value (FMV) is the price that an asset would sell for on the open market. Fair market value has come to represent the price of an asset under the following usual set of conditions: prospective buyers and sellers are reasonably knowledgeable about the asset, behaving in their own best interest, free of undue pressure to trade, and given a reasonable time period for completing the transaction. Given these conditions, an asset's fair market value should represent an accurate valuation or assessment of its worth. The term is commonly used in tax law and the real estate market."
Fair Value,"Fair value is a term with several meanings in the financial world. In investing, it refers to an asset's sale price agreed upon by a willing buyer and seller, assuming both parties are knowledgeable and enter the transaction freely.

Forward markets are used for trading a range of instruments, but the term is primarily used with reference to the foreign exchange market. It can also apply to markets for securities and interest rates as well as commodities."
Forward Points,"In currency trading, forward points are the number of basis points added to or subtracted from the current spot rate of a currency pair to determine the forward rate for delivery on a specific value date. When points are added to the spot rate this is called a forward premium; when points are subtracted from the spot rate it is a forward discount. The forward rate is based on the difference between the interest rates of the two currencies (currency deals always involve two currencies) and the time until the maturity of the deal."
Forward Premium,A forward premium is a situation in which the forward or expected future price for a currency is greater than the spot price. It is an indication by the market that the current domestic exchange rate is going to increase against the other currency.
Forward Price-To-Earnings (Forward P/E),"Forward price-to-earnings (forward P/E) is a version of the ratio of price-to-earnings (P/E) that uses forecasted earnings for the P/E calculation. While the earnings used in this formula are just an estimate and not as reliable as current or historical earnings data, there are still benefits to estimated P/E analysis."
Four Asian Tigers,"The Four Asian Tigers are the high-growth economies of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. Fueled by exports and rapid industrialization, the Four Asian Tigers have consistently maintained high levels of economic growth since the 1960s, and have collectively joined the ranks of the world's wealthiest nations."
Four Percent Rule,"The Four Percent Rule is a rule of thumb used to determine how much a retiree should withdraw from a retirement account each year. This rule seeks to provide a steady income stream to the retiree while also maintaining an account balance that keeps income flowing through retirement. Experts are divided on whether the 4% withdrawal rate is safe, as the withdrawals will consist primarily of interest and dividends."
Four Ps,"The four Ps of marketing are the key factors that are involved in the marketing of a good or service. They are the product, price, place, and promotion of a good or service. Often referred to as the marketing mix, the four Ps are constrained by internal and external factors in the overall business environment, and they interact significantly with one another."
Fourth World,"The Fourth World is an outdated term used to describe the most underdeveloped, poverty-stricken, and marginalized regions of the world."
Fractal Indicator,"The fractal indicator is based on a simple price pattern that is frequently seen in financial markets. Outside of trading, a fractal is a recurring geometric pattern that is repeated on all time frames. From this concept, the fractal indicator was devised. The indicator isolates potential turning points on a price chart. It then draws arrows to indicate the existence of a pattern. The bullish fractal pattern signals the price could move higher. A bearish fractal signals the price could move lower. Bullish fractals are marked by a down arrow, and bearish fractals are marked by an up arrow."
Fractional Reserve Banking,Fractional reserve banking is a system in which only a fraction of bank deposits are backed by actual cash on hand and available for withdrawal. This is done to theoretically expand the economy by freeing capital for lending.
Fractional Share,"Less than one full share of equity is called a fractional share. Such shares may be the result of stock splits, dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs), or similar corporate actions.

Franchisee,"A franchisee is a small business owner who operates a franchise. The franchisee has purchased the right to use an existing business's trademarks, associated brands, and other proprietary knowledge to market and sell the same brand, and uphold the same standards as the first business. Franchisees become owners and independent operators of third-party retail outlets called franchises."
Franked Dividend,A franked dividend is an arrangement in Australia that eliminates the double taxation of dividends. The shareholder can reduce the tax paid on the dividend by an amount equal to the tax imputation credits.﻿﻿ An individual’s marginal tax rate and the tax rate for the company issuing the dividend affect how much tax an individual owes on a dividend.
Fraud,"Fraud is an intentionally deceptive action designed to provide the perpetrator with an unlawful gain or to deny a right to a victim.

Free Cash Flow (FCF),"Free cash flow (FCF) represents the cash a company generates after accounting for cash outflows to support operations and maintain its capital assets. Unlike earnings or net income, free cash flow is a measure of profitability that excludes the non-cash expenses of the income statement and includes spending on equipment and assets as well as changes in working capital from the balance sheet."
Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE),"Free cash flow to equity is a measure of how much cash is available to the equity shareholders of a company after all expenses, reinvestment, and debt are paid. FCFE is a measure of equity capital usage."
Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF),"Free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) represents the amount of cash flow from operations available for distribution after accounting for depreciation expenses, taxes, working capital, and investments. FCFF is a measurement of a company's profitability after all expenses and reinvestments. It is one of the many benchmarks used to compare and analyze a firm's financial health."
Free Cash Flow Yield,"Free cash flow yield is a financial solvency ratio that compares the free cash flow per share a company is expected to earn against its market value per share. The ratio is calculated by taking the free cash flow per share divided by the current share price. Free cash flow yield is similar in nature to the earnings yield metric, which is usually meant to measure GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per share divided by share price."
Free Enterprise,"Free enterprise, or the free market, refers to an economy where the market determines prices, products, and services rather than the government. Businesses and services are free of government control. Alternatively, free enterprise could refer to an ideological or legal system whereby commercial activities are primarily regulated through private measures."
Free-Float Methodology,"The free-float methodology is a method of calculating the market capitalization of a stock market index's underlying companies.

Free Look Period,"The free look period is a required period of time in which a new life insurance policy owner can terminate the policy without penalties, such as surrender charges. A free look period often lasts 10 or more days (depending on the insurer), allowing the contract holder to decide whether or not to keep the insurance policy; if they are not satisfied and wish to cancel, the policy purchaser can receive a full refund."
Free Market,"The free market is an economic system based on supply and demand with little or no government control. It is a summary description of all voluntary exchanges that take place in a given economic environment.

""FOB shipping point"" or ""FOB origin"" means the buyer is at risk and takes ownership of goods once the seller ships the product. Historically, FOB was used only to refer to goods transported by ship; in the United States, the term has since been expanded to include all types of transportation."
Free Rider Problem,The free rider problem is the burden on a shared resource that is created by its use or overuse by people who aren't paying their fair share for it or aren't paying anything at all.
Free Trade,"A free trade agreement is a pact between two or more nations to reduce barriers to imports and exports among them. Under a free trade policy, goods and services can be bought and sold across international borders with little or no government tariffs, quotas, subsidies, or prohibitions to inhibit their exchange."
Free Trade Area,"A free trade area is a region in which a group of countries has signed a free trade agreement and maintain little or no barriers to trade in the form of tariffs or quotas between each other. Free trade areas facilitate international trade and the associated gains from trade along with the international division of labor and specialization. However, free trade areas have been criticized both for costs that are associated with increasing economic integration and for artificially restraining free trade."
Freemium,"A combination of the words ""free"" and ""premium,"" the term freemium is a type of business model that offers basic features to users at no cost and charges a premium for supplemental or advanced features. A company using a freemium model provides basic services for free often in a ""free trial"" or limited version for the user, while also offering more advanced services or additional features at a premium."
Freudian Motivation Theory,"Freudian motivation theory posits that unconscious psychological forces, such as hidden desires and motives, shape an individual's behavior, like their purchasing patterns. This theory was developed by Sigmund Freud who, in addition to being a medical doctor, is synonymous with the field of psychoanalysis."
Frictional Unemployment,"Frictional unemployment is the result of voluntary employment transitions within an economy. Frictional unemployment naturally occurs, even in a growing, stable economy. Workers choosing to leave their jobs in search of new ones and workers entering the workforce for the first time constitute frictional unemployment. It does not include workers who remain in their current job until finding a new one, as, obviously, they are never unemployed."
Friedrich Engels,"Friedrich Engels was a German philosopher, social scientist, journalist, and businessman who lived from 1820 to 1895. His collection of work done with Karl Marx laid the groundwork for modern communism. Engels and Marx wrote and published many articles and books together that attempted to expose the uneven distribution of wealth gained during the Industrial Revolution. Their writings see capitalism as an exploitative system that benefits the owners of land, capital, and means of production more than the workforce. Specifically, Engels and Marx claimed that the surplus value created by workers in excess of wages produced significant profits for owners of capital—a central theme in Engel's contributions to modern communism."
Friedrich Hayek,"Friedrich Hayek is a famous economist born in Vienna, Austria, in 1899. He is well-known for his numerous contributions to the field of economics and political philosophy. Hayek's approach mostly stems from the Austrian school of economics and emphasizes the limited nature of knowledge. He is particularly famous for his defense of free-market capitalism and is remembered as one of the greatest critics of the socialist consensus."

Some fringe benefits are given universally to all employees of a company while others may be offered only to those at executive levels. Some benefits are awarded to compensate employees for costs related to their work while others are geared to general job satisfaction.
Front-End Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI),"The front-end debt-to-income ratio (DTI) is a variation of the DTI that calculates how much of a person's gross income is going toward housing costs. If a homeowner has a mortgage, the front-end DTI is typically calculated as housing expenses (such as mortgage payments, mortgage insurance, etc.) divided by gross income. In contrast, a back-end DTI calculates the percentage of gross income going toward other debt types, such as credit cards or car loans. You may also hear these ratios referred to as ""Housing 1"" and ""Housing 2,"" or ""Basic"" and ""Broad,"" respectively."
Front-End Load,"A front-end load is a commission or sales charge applied at the time of the initial purchase of an investment. The term most often applies to mutual fund investments, but may also apply to insurance policies or annuities. The front-end load is deducted from the initial deposit, or purchase funds and, as a result, lowers the amount of money actually going into the investment product."

Specifically, it is an anti-dilution provision that applies, for any shares of common stock sold by a company after the issuing of an option (or convertible security), the lowest sale price as the adjusted option price or conversion ratio for existing shareholders."
Fully Amortizing Payment,"A fully amortizing payment refers to a type of periodic repayment on a debt. If the borrower makes payments according to the loan's amortization schedule, the debt is fully paid off by the end of its set term. If the loan is a fixed-rate loan, each fully amortizing payment is an equal dollar amount. If the loan is an adjustable-rate loan, the fully amortizing payment changes as the interest rate on the loan changes."
Fully Diluted Shares,"Fully diluted shares are the total number of common shares of a company that will be outstanding and available to trade on the open market after all possible sources of conversion, such as convertible bonds and employee stock options, are exercised. Fully diluted shares include not only those which are currently issued but also those that could be claimed through conversion. This number of shares is needed for a company’s earnings per share (EPS) calculations because applying fully diluted shares increases the share basis in the calculation while reducing the dollars earned per share of common stock."
Fully Vested,"Being fully vested means a person has rights to the full amount of some benefit, most commonly employee benefits such as stock options, profit sharing, or retirement benefits. Benefits that must be fully vested benefits often accrue to employees each year, but they only become the employee's property according to a vesting schedule."

A fund can be established for many different purposes: a city government setting aside money to build a new civic center, a college setting aside money to award a scholarship, or an insurance company that setts aside money to pay its customers’ claims."
Fund Flow,"Fund flow is the net of all cash inflows and outflows in and out of various financial assets. Fund flow is usually measured on a monthly or quarterly basis. The performance of an asset or fund is not taken into account, only share redemptions, or outflows, and share purchases, or inflows. Net inflows create excess cash for managers to invest, which theoretically creates demand for securities such as stocks and bonds."
Fund Manager,"A fund manager is responsible for implementing a fund's investing strategy and managing its portfolio trading activities. The fund can be managed by one person, by two people as co-managers, or by a team of three or more people."
Fund of Funds (FOF),"A fund of funds (FOF)—also known as a multi-manager investment—is a pooled investment fund that invests in other types of funds. In other words, its portfolio contains different underlying portfolios of other funds. These holdings replace any investing directly in bonds, stocks, and other types of securities."

Fundamental analysts study anything that can affect the security's value, from macroeconomic factors such as the state of the economy and industry conditions to microeconomic factors like the effectiveness of the company's management."
Fundamentals,"Fundamentals include the basic qualitative and quantitative information that contributes to the financial or economic well-being of a company, security, or currency, and their subsequent financial valuation. Where qualitative information includes elements that cannot be directly measured, such as management experience, quantitative analysis (QA) uses mathematics and statistics to understand the asset and predict its movements."
Funded Debt,Funded debt is a company's debt that matures in more than one year or one business cycle. This type of debt is classified as such because it is funded by interest payments made by the borrowing firm over the term of the loan.
Funds From Operations (FFO),Funds from operations (FFO) refers to the figure used by real estate investment trusts (REITs) to define the cash flow from their operations. Real estate companies use FFO as a measurement of operating performance.
Funds Transfer Pricing (FTP),"Funds transfer pricing (FTP) is a system used to estimate how funding is adding to the overall profitability of a company. FTP sees its most significant use in the banking industry where financial institutions use FTP as a way to analyze the strengths and failings of the firm within the institution. Funds transfer pricing may also help with determining the profitability of various product lines the bank offers, the performance of branch outlets, and judge the effectiveness of processes."
Fungibility,"Fungibility is the ability of a good or asset to be interchanged with other individual goods or assets of the same type. Fungible assets simplify the exchange and trade processes, as fungibility implies equal value between the assets."
"Furniture, Fixtures, and Equipment (FF&E)","Furniture, fixtures, and equipment (abbreviated as FF&E or FFE) refers to movable furniture, fixtures, or other equipment that have no permanent connection to the structure of a building. These items, which include desks, chairs, computers, electronic equipment, tables, bookcases, and partitions, typically depreciate substantially over their long-term use but are nevertheless important costs to consider when valuing a company, especially during liquidation events."
Future Value (FV),"Future value (FV) is the value of a current asset at a future date based on an assumed rate of growth. The future value is important to investors and financial planners, as they use it to estimate how much an investment made today will be worth in the future. Knowing the future value enables investors to make sound investment decisions based on their anticipated needs. However, external economic factors, such as inflation, can adversely affect the future value of the asset by eroding its value."
Future Value of an Annuity,"The future value of an annuity is the value of a group of recurring payments at a certain date in the future, assuming a particular rate of return, or discount rate. The higher the discount rate, the greater the annuity's future value."
Futures,"Futures are derivative financial contracts that obligate the parties to transact an asset at a predetermined future date and price. The buyer must purchase or the seller must sell the underlying asset at the set price, regardless of the current market price at the expiration date."
Futures Commission Merchant (FCM),A futures commission merchant (FCM) plays an essential role in enabling customers to participate in the futures markets. An FCM is an individual or organization involved in the solicitation or acceptance of buy or sell orders for futures or options on futures in exchange for payment of money (commission) or other assets from customers. An FCM also has the responsibility of collecting margin from customers. The FCM is also responsible for ensuring asset delivery after the futures contract has expired.﻿﻿
Futures Market,A futures market is an auction market in which participants buy and sell commodity and futures contracts for delivery on a specified future date. Futures are exchange-traded derivatives contracts that lock in future delivery of a commodity or security at a price set today.

GAFAM Stocks,"GAFAM is an acronym for five popular U.S. tech stocks: Google (Alphabet), Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft."
Gain,"A gain is a general increase in the value of an asset or property. A gain arises if the current price of something is higher than the original purchase price. For accounting and tax purposes, gains may be classified in several ways, for example as gross vs. net gains or realized vs. unrealized (paper) gains. Capital gains may additionally be classified as short-term vs. long-term in nature."
Gambler's Fallacy,"The gambler's fallacy, also known as the Monte Carlo fallacy, occurs when an individual erroneously believes that a certain random event is less likely or more likely to happen based on the outcome of a previous event or series of events. This line of thinking is incorrect, since past events do not change the probability that certain events will occur in the future."
Game Changer,"The term game-changer refers to an individual or company that significantly alters the way things are done as a whole. Individual game-changers find a way to stand out by way of their personality. Game-changing companies are able to switch things up and form new business plans and strategies that place them above their competition. By mere virtue of their actions, game-changers can make changes that transform the landscape as a whole."
Game Theory,"Game theory is a theoretical framework for conceiving social situations among competing players. In some respects, game theory is the science of strategy, or at least the optimal decision-making of independent and competing actors in a strategic setting."
Gamification,"Gamification describes the incentivisation of people's engagement in non-game contexts and activities by using game-style mechanics. Gamification leverages people's natural tendencies for competition, achievement, collaboration, and charity. Tools employed in game design, such as rewarding users for achievements, ""leveling-up,"" and earning badges, are carried into the real world to help motivate individuals to achieve their goals or boost performance. There are many examples of gamification, the most well-known perhaps being frequent flyer rewards programs offered by airlines. The important measurable metrics of success from gamification include the level of engagement, influence, brand loyalty, time spent on an activity, and the game's ability to go viral."
Gamma Hedging,"Gamma hedging is a trading strategy that tries to maintain a constant delta in an options position, often one that is delta-neutral, as the underlying asset changes price. It is used to reduce the risk created when the underlying security makes strong up or down moves, particularly during the last days before expiration."
Gamma Neutral,A gamma neutral options position is one that has been immunized to large moves in an underlying security. Achieving a gamma neutral position is a method of managing risk in options trading by establishing an asset portfolio whose delta's rate of change is close to zero even as the underlying rises or falls. This is known as gamma hedging. A gamma-neutral portfolio is thus hedged against second-order time price sensitivity.
Gann Angles,"Gann angles are named after their creator W.D. Gann. Gann believed the angles could predict future price movements based on geometric angles of time versus price. Gann was a 20th-century market theorist. The validity and usefulness of his theories, however, are subject to debate."
Gann Fans,Gann fans are a form of technical analysis based on the idea that the market is geometric and cyclical in nature. A Gann fan consists of a series of lines called Gann angles. These angles are superimposed over a price chart to show potential support and resistance levels. The resulting image is supposed to help technical analysts predict price changes.
Gantt Chart,"A Gantt chart is a graphical depiction of a project schedule. It's is a type of bar chart that shows the start and finish dates of several elements of a project that include resources, milestones, tasks, and dependencies. Henry Gantt, an American mechanical engineer, designed the Gantt chart."
Gap,"A gap is an area discontinuity in a security's chart where its price either rises or falls from the previous day’s close with no trading occurring in between. Gaps are common when news causes market fundamentals to change during hours when markets are typically closed, for instance an earnings call after-hours."
Gap Analysis,"A gap analysis is the process companies use to compare their current performance with their desired, expected performance. This analysis is used to determine whether a company is meeting expectations and using its resources effectively."
Gapping,"Gapping occurs when the price of a stock, or another asset, opens above or below the previous day’s close with no trading activity in between. A gap is the area discontinuity in a security's price chart. Gaps may materialize when headlines cause market fundamentals to change rapidly during hours when markets are typically closed; for instance, the result of an earnings call after-hours."
Garage Liability Insurance,"Garage liability insurance is specialty insurance targeted to the automotive industry. Automobile dealerships, parking lots or parking garages operators, tow-truck operators, service stations, and customization and repair shops will add garage liability insurance to their business liability coverage.

Gartley Pattern,"The Gartley pattern is a harmonic chart pattern, based on Fibonacci numbers and ratios, that helps traders identify reaction highs and lows. In his book Profits in the Stock Market, H.M. Gartley laid down the foundation for harmonic chart patterns in 1935. The Gartley pattern is the most commonly used harmonic chart pattern. Larry Pesavento later applied Fibonacci ratios to the pattern in his book Fibonacci Ratios with Pattern Recognition."
Gas (Ethereum),"Gas refers to the fee, or pricing value, required to successfully conduct a transaction or execute a contract on the Ethereum blockchain platform. Priced in small fractions of the cryptocurrency ether (ETH), commonly referred to as gwei and sometimes also called nanoeth, the gas is used to allocate resources of the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) so that decentralized applications such as smart contracts can self-execute in a secured but decentralized fashion."
Gas Guzzler Tax,"The gas guzzler tax is a surcharge added to the sales or lease price of cars in the U.S. that have poor fuel economy ratings.

Growing-Equity Mortgage,"A growing-equity mortgage (GEM) is a type of fixed-rate mortgage where monthly payments increase over time according to a set schedule, rather than remaining fixed and equal over the loan term. The interest rate on the loan does not change, and there is never any negative amortization.

Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP),Growth at a reasonable price (GARP) is an equity investment strategy that seeks to combine tenets of both growth investing and value investing to select individual stocks. GARP investors look for companies that are showing consistent earnings growth above broad market levels while excluding companies that have very high valuations.

When investors invest in growth stocks, they anticipate that they will earn money through capital gains when they eventually sell their shares in the future."
Grunt Work,"Grunt work is an expression used to describe thankless and menial work. Grunt work can also refer to jobs that either lack glamour and prestige or are boring and repetitive.

It guarantees the policyholder a steady stream of annual withdrawals via the return of all premiums paid into the contract, regardless of an investment's performance, through a series of annual withdrawals. A GMWB is unlike a guaranteed minimum income benefit (GMIB), where the latter offers a payout of specified minimum periodic income after a waiting period, regardless of the variable annuity's investment performance."
Guaranteed Payments to Partners,"Guaranteed payments to partners are payments meant to compensate a partner for services rendered or use of capital. Essentially, they are the equivalent of a salary for partners or limited liability company (LLC) members.

The transaction usually involves derivatives, such as options or futures contracts, but it can be done with inversely correlated assets as well. Hedging transactions can take many different forms. While they are generally used to limit the losses that a position faces if the initial investing thesis is incorrect, they can also be used to lock in a specific amount of profit. Hedging transactions are a common tool for businesses as well as portfolio managers looking to lower their overall portfolio risk."
Hedonic Pricing,Hedonic pricing is a model that identifies price factors according to the premise that price is determined both by internal characteristics of the good being sold and external factors affecting it.
Hedonic Regression Method,"Hedonic regression is the use of a regression model to estimate the influence that various factors have on the price of a good, or sometimes the demand for a good. In a hedonic regression model, the dependent variable is the price (or demand) of the good, and the independent variables are the attributes of the good believed to influence utility for the buyer or consumer of the good. The resulting estimated coefficients on the independent variables can be interpreted as the weights that buyers place on the various qualities of the good."
Hedonic Treadmill,A hedonic treadmill is the tendency of a person to remain at a relatively stable level of happiness despite a change in fortune or the achievement of major goals. The hedonic treadmill is also referred to as the hedonistic treadmill or hedonic adaptation.

Heterodox Economics,"Heterodox economics is the analysis and study of economic principles considered outside of mainstream or orthodox schools of economic thought. Schools of heterodox economics vary widely and have few common characteristics other than propounding theories, assumptions, or methodologies that fall outside of or contradict the mainstream Keynesian and neoclassical movements."
Heteroskedastic,"Heteroskedastic refers to a condition in which the variance of the residual term, or error term, in a regression model varies widely. If this is true, it may vary in a systematic way, and there may be some factor that can explain this. If so, then the model may be poorly defined and should be modified so that this systematic variance is explained by one or more additional predictor variables."
Heteroskedasticity,"In statistics, heteroskedasticity (or heteroscedasticity) happens when the standard deviations of a predicted variable, monitored over different values of an independent variable or as related to prior time periods, are non-constant. With heteroskedasticity, the tell-tale sign upon visual inspection of the residual errors is that they will tend to fan out over time, as depicted in the image below."
Heuristics,"A heuristic, or a heuristic technique, is any approach to problem-solving that uses a practical method or various shortcuts in order to produce solutions that may not be optimal but are sufficient given a limited timeframe or deadline. Heuristics methods are intended to be flexible and are used for quick decisions, especially when finding an optimal solution is either impossible or impractical and when working with complex data."

Hidden Taxes,"Hidden taxes are taxes indirectly assessed on consumer goods without the explicitly knowledge of consumers who purchase the product. At the heart of the concept of a hidden tax is the notion that if you cannot see it, your purchasing behavior will be largely unchanged. With the advent of modern transactional systems, visibility into a variety of hidden taxes ranging from highway tolls paid using automatic transponders to music downloads is becoming more obscured."
Hidden Values,Hidden values are assets that are undervalued on a company's balance sheet and therefore may not be incorporated into or reflected in the company's share price.

High-Yield Bond,"High-yield bonds (also called junk bonds) are bonds that pay higher interest rates because they have lower credit ratings than investment-grade bonds. High-yield bonds are more likely to default, so they must pay a higher yield than investment-grade bonds to compensate investors."
High-Yield Bond Spread,"A high-yield bond spread is the percentage difference in current yields of various classes of high-yield bonds compared against investment-grade corporate bonds, Treasury bonds, or another benchmark bond measure. Spreads are often expressed as a difference in percentage points or basis points. The high-yield bond spread is also referred to as credit spread."

Highly Leveraged Transaction (HLT),"A highly leveraged transaction (HLT) is a bank loan to a company which has a large amount of debt. Highly leveraged transactions were popularized in the 1980s as a way to finance buyouts, acquisitions or recapitalizations. Highly leveraged transactions are risky in that they add to a company's debt load and often result in an unattractive debt-to-equity ratio, but the interest income generated from these transactions is significant enough to make them attractive to investors and financial institutions."
Hikkake Pattern,"The hikkake pattern is a price pattern used by technical analysts and traders hoping to identify a short-term move in the market's direction. The pattern has two different setups, one implying a short-term downward movement in price action, and a second setup implying a short-term upward trend in price."

The term hire purchase is commonly used in the United Kingdom and it's more commonly known as an installment plan in the United States. However, there can be a difference between the two: With some installment plans, the buyer gets the ownership rights as soon as the contract is signed with the seller. With hire purchase agreements, the ownership of the merchandise is not officially transferred to the buyer until all the payments have been made."
Hiring Freeze,"A hiring freeze is when an employer temporarily halts non-essential hiring of personnel to reduce costs, usually when an organization is under financial duress. Such a cost-cutting effort may also be undertaken by management due to a recession or other economic or market dislocation or crisis, such as one that causes production overcapacity or redundancy."

Historic Structure,"A historic structure is a sub-category of a historic property as designated by the National Register of Historic Places, referred to as the National Register. In casual conversation, a historic structure refers to a building or other structure, such as a bridge, mine, canal, ship, highway, or locomotive, that is significant because of its link to an important period in the past, but the official designation distinguishes a structure as being distinct from a human shelter."
Historical Cost,A historical cost is a measure of value used in accounting in which the value of an asset on the balance sheet is recorded at its original cost when acquired by the company. The historical cost method is used for fixed assets in the United States under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
Historical Returns,"Historical returns are often associated with the past performance of a security or index, such as the S&P 500. Analysts review historical return data when trying to predict future returns or to estimate how a security might react to a particular situation, such as a drop in consumer spending. Historical returns can also be useful when estimating where future points of data may fall in terms of standard deviations."
Historical Volatility (HV),"Historical volatility (HV) is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index over a given period of time. Generally, this measure is calculated by determining the average deviation from the average price of a financial instrument in the given time period. Using standard deviation is the most common, but not the only, way to calculate historical volatility. The higher the historical volatility value, the riskier the security. However, that is not necessarily a bad result as risk works both ways—bullish and bearish."
Hit the Bid,"‘Hit the bid’ is a trading term used for when a trader agrees to sell at the market bid or bid price quoted by another trader. The bid price is the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a security or asset.

Hobby Loss,The term hobby loss refers to a loss that results from a business deemed to be a recreational activity or hobby by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Taxpayers cannot claim and recoup this money when the agency says it is spent while pursuing a hobby. That's because losses aren't allowed for expenses in excess of hobby income.﻿﻿ This means these expenses aren't deductible as they are with a business.﻿﻿
Hockey Stick Chart,A hockey stick chart is a price line chart in which a sharp increase occurs suddenly after a short period of quiescence or relative stability. The line connecting the data points thus resembles a hockey stick.
Hodrick-Prescott (HP) Filter,The Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter refers to a data-smoothing technique.

This can help with economic or other forecasting associated with the business cycle.
Holacracy,"A holacracy is a system of corporate governance whereby members of a team or business form distinct, autonomous, yet symbiotic, teams to accomplish tasks and company goals. The concept of a corporate hierarchy is discarded in favor of a flat organizational structure where all workers have an equal voice while simultaneously answering to the direction of shared authority."

This suggests a level of consistency and makes it easier to model and work with the data through regression. However, the lack of homoskedasticity may suggest that the regression model may need to include additional predictor variables to explain the performance of the dependent variable."

HR plays a key role in helping companies deal with a fast-changing business environment and a greater demand for quality employees in the 21st century."
Humped Yield Curve,"A humped yield curve is a relatively rare type of yield curve that results when the interest rates on medium-term fixed income securities are higher than the rates of both long and short-term instruments. Also, if short-term interest rates are expected to rise and then fall, then a humped yield curve will ensue. Humped yield curves are also known as bell-shaped curves."
Hundredweight (Cwt),A hundredweight (CWT) is a unit of measurement used to define the quantities of certain commodities being bought and sold. It is used in some commodities trading contracts. Pricing by hundredweight also is a standard option for shipping packages that take up less than an entire truckload.
Hung Convertibles,"Hung convertibles are convertible securities where the share price of the underlying is well below the conversion price, making it unlikely that the securities will be converted into common stock."
Hurdle Rate,"A hurdle rate is the minimum rate of return on a project or investment required by a manager or investor. It allows companies to make important decisions on whether or not to pursue a specific project. The hurdle rate describes the appropriate compensation for the level of risk present—riskier projects generally have higher hurdle rates than those with less risk. In order to determine the rate, the following are some of the areas that must be taken into consideration: associated risks, cost of capital, and the returns of other possible investments or projects."
Hurricane Deductible,"Actually, hurricane insurance doesn't exist as a specific, separate type of policy. The term usually refers to what is, strictly speaking, a hurricane deductible on a homeowners insurance policy: an extra amount a homeowner must pay before the insurer will cover the damage or destruction caused by a hurricane. A percentage of the property's worth, this deductible is common in 19 hurricane-prone states and Washington D.C."
Hybrid Annuity,"A hybrid annuity is a retirement income investment that allows investors to split their funds between fixed-rate and variable-rate components. Investors can divide their savings between conservative assets that offer a low but guaranteed rate of return and riskier assets that offer the potential for higher returns. As in any annuity, the goal is to create a steady stream of income during retirement."
Hybrid ARM,"A hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage, or hybrid ARM (also known as a ""fixed-period ARM""), blends characteristics of a fixed-rate mortgage with an adjustable-rate mortgage. This type of mortgage will have an initial fixed interest rate period followed by an adjustable rate period. After the fixed interest rate expires, the interest rate starts to adjust based on an index plus a margin. The date at which the mortgage changes from the fixed rate to the adjustable rate is referred to as the reset date."
Hybrid Fund,A hybrid fund is an investment fund that is characterized by diversification among two or more asset classes. These funds typically invest in a mix of stocks and bonds. They may also be known as asset allocation funds.
Hybrid Security,"A hybrid security is a single financial security that combines two or more different financial instruments. Hybrid securities, often referred to as ""hybrids,"" generally combine both debt and equity characteristics. The most common type of hybrid security is a convertible bond that has features of an ordinary bond but is heavily influenced by the price movements of the stock into which it is convertible."
Hydraulic Fracturing,"Hydraulic fracturing is a process which injects high-pressure liquid into an oil- or gas-bearing rock formation to create fractures. This pressure typically yields improved flows, making it useful for oil and gas firms seeking more economical production in areas that would otherwise produce low-flow wells."
Hydrocarbon,"A hydrocarbon is an organic chemical compound composed exclusively of hydrogen and carbon atoms. Hydrocarbons are naturally-occurring compounds and form the basis of crude oil, natural gas, coal, and other important energy sources."
Hyperdeflation,"Hyperdeflation is an extremely large and relatively quick level of deflation in an economy. Hyperdeflation occurs when the purchasing power of currency rises drastically in a relatively short period of time. This increase results in debts being more pronounced, as the real value of goods and services increases and the value of the currency falls."
Hyperledger,"Hyperledger is a global enterprise blockchain project that offers the necessary framework, standards, guidelines, and tools to build open source blockchains and related applications for use across various industries.

HyperText Markup Language (HTML),HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted into a file intended for display on the Internet. The markup tells web browsers how to display a web page's words and images.
Hypothecation,"Hypothecation occurs when an asset is pledged as collateral to secure a loan. The owner of the asset does not give up title, possession, or ownership rights, such as income generated by the asset. However, the lender can seize the asset if the terms of the agreement are not met."
Hypothesis Testing,Hypothesis testing is an act in statistics whereby an analyst tests an assumption regarding a population parameter. The methodology employed by the analyst depends on the nature of the data used and the reason for the analysis.
Hysteresis,"Hysteresis in the field of economics refers to an event in the economy that persists even after the factors that led to that event have been removed or otherwise run their course. Hysteresis often occurs following extreme or prolonged economic events such as an economic crash or recession. After a recession, for example, the unemployment rate may continue to increase despite growth in the economy and the technical end of the recession."
Iceberg Order,"Iceberg orders are large single orders that have been divided into smaller limit orders, usually through the use of an automated program, for the purpose of hiding the actual order quantity. The term ""iceberg"" comes from the fact that the visible lots are just the ""tip of the iceberg"" given the greater number of limit orders ready to be placed. They are also sometimes referred to as reserve orders."
Ichimoku Cloud,"The Ichimoku Cloud is a collection of technical indicators that show support and resistance levels, as well as momentum and trend direction. It does this by taking multiple averages and plotting them on a chart. It also uses these figures to compute a “cloud” that attempts to forecast where the price may find support or resistance in the future."
Ichimoku Kinko Hyo,"The Ichimoku Kinko Hyo, or Ichimoku for short, is a technical indicator that is used to gauge momentum along with future areas of support and resistance.

Ideations can spring forth from past or present knowledge, external influences, opinions, convictions, or principles. Ideation can be expressed in graphical, written, or verbal terms."
Identifiable Asset,"An identifiable asset is an asset whose commercial or fair value can be measured at a given point in time, and which is expected to provide a future benefit to the company. These assets are an important consideration in the context of mergers and acquisitions."
Identity Theft,"Identity theft is the crime of obtaining the personal or financial information of another person to use their identity to commit fraud, such as making unauthorized transactions or purchases. Identity theft is committed in many different ways and its victims are typically left with damage to their credit, finances, and reputation."
Idiosyncratic Risk,"Idiosyncratic risk is a type of investment risk that is endemic to an individual asset (like a particular company's stock), or a group of assets (like a particular sector's stocks), or in some cases, a very specific asset class (like collateralized mortgage obligations). Idiosyncratic risk is also referred to as a specific risk or unsystematic risk. Therefore, the opposite of idiosyncratic risk is a systematic risk, which is the overall risk that affects all assets, such as fluctuations in the stock market, interest rates, or the entire financial system."
Idle Time,"Idle time is paid time that an employee, or machine, is unproductive due to factors that can either be controlled or uncontrolled by management. It normally applies to full-time workers rather than consultants, who typically have to bill for every hour of their time."
Illiquid,"Illiquid refers to the state of a stock, bond, or other assets that cannot easily and readily be sold or exchanged for cash without a substantial loss in value. Illiquid assets may be hard to sell quickly because there is low trading activity or interest in the issue, indicated by a lack of ready and willing investors or speculators to purchase or sell the asset. As a result, illiquid assets tend to have lower trading volume, wider bid-ask spreads, and greater price volatility."
Immediate Family,"Most of us know how we define ""immediate family"" in our own minds, but our views of the matter may not matter when it comes to its definition in the fine print of legal documents or company policies. In general, a person's immediate family is his or her smallest family unit, including parents, siblings, spouse, and children. It may include relatives through marriage, such as a mother-in-law. But the exact inclusions may differ depending on the law or organization that defines an individual's immediate family."
Immediate Or Cancel Order (IOC),"An immediate or cancel order (IOC) is an order to buy or sell a security that attempts to execute all or part immediately and then cancels any unfilled portion of the order. An IOC order is one of several ""duration,"" or time in force orders, that investors can use to specify how long the order remains active in the market and under what conditions the order is canceled."
Immediate Payment Annuity,"An immediate payment annuity is a contract between an individual and an insurance company that pays the owner, or annuitant, a guaranteed income starting almost immediately. It differs from a deferred annuity, which begins payments at a future date chosen by the annuity owner. An immediate payment annuity is also known as a single-premium immediate annuity (SPIA), an income annuity, or simply an immediate annuity."
Immunization,"Immunization, also known as multi-period immunization, is a risk-mitigation strategy that matches the duration of assets and liabilities in order to minimize the impact of interest rates on net worth over time."
Impact Investing,Impact investing is an investment strategy that aims to generate specific beneficial social or environmental effects in addition to financial gains. Impact investments may take the form of numerous asset classes and may result in many specific outcomes. The point of impact investing is to use money and investment capital for positive social results.
Impaired Asset,"An impaired asset is an asset that has a market value less than the value listed on the company's balance sheet. When an asset is deemed to be impaired, it will need to be written down on the company's balance sheet to its current market value."
Impaired Credit,"Impaired credit occurs when there has been a deterioration in the creditworthiness of an individual or entity. This is usually reflected through a lower credit score, in the case of an individual, or a reduction in the credit rating assigned to an entity or debt issued by a rating agency or lender. As a result, the borrower whose credit has been impaired will generally have lesser accessibility to credit facilities and will have to pay a higher rate of interest on loans. Impaired credit may either be a temporary situation that can be reversed, or an early sign that the borrower could face potential major financial distress down the road. In either case, impaired credit is not a good omen."
Impairment,"In accounting, impairment describes a permanent reduction in the value of a company's asset, typically a fixed asset or an intangible asset. When testing an asset for impairment, the total profit, cash flow, or other benefit expected to be generated by that specific asset is periodically compared with its current book value. If it is determined that the book value of the asset exceeds the future cash flow or benefit of the asset, the difference between the two is written off and the value of the asset declines on the company's balance sheet."
Impeachment,"Impeachment, as authorized by Article II, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution, is the formal process that allows Congress to bring charges of ""Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors"" against high-ranking civil officers, such as the president."
Imperfect Competition,"Imperfect competition exists whenever a market, hypothetical or real, violates the abstract tenets of neoclassical perfect competition. In this environment, companies sell different products and services, set their own individual prices, fight for market share, and are often protected by barriers to entry and exit."
Imperfect Market,"An imperfect market refers to any economic market that does not meet the rigorous standards of the hypothetical perfectly—or purely—competitive market. Pure or perfect competition is an abstract, theoretical market structure in which a series of criteria are met. Since all real markets exist outside of the spectrum of the perfect competition model, all real markets can be classified as imperfect markets."
Implicit Cost,"An implicit cost is any cost that has already occurred but not necessarily shown or reported as a separate expense. It represents an opportunity cost that arises when a company uses internal resources toward a project without any explicit compensation for the utilization of resources. This means when a company allocates its resources, it always forgoes the ability to earn money off the use of the resources elsewhere, so there's no exchange of cash. Put simply, an implicit cost comes from the use of an asset, rather than renting or buying it."
Implied Authority,"Implied authority refers to an agent with the jurisdiction to perform acts that are reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose of an organization. Under contract law, implied authority figures have the ability to make a legally binding contract on behalf of another person or company."
Implied Contract,"An implied contract is a legally-binding obligation that derives from actions, conduct, or circumstances of one or more parties in an agreement. It has the same legal force as an express contract, which is a contract that is voluntarily entered into and agreed on verbally or in writing by two or more parties. The implied contract, on the other hand, is assumed to exist, but no written or verbal confirmation is necessary."
Implied Rate,The implied rate is the difference between the spot interest rate and the interest rate for the forward or futures delivery date.
Implied Volatility (IV),"Implied volatility is a metric that captures the market's view of the likelihood of changes in a given security's price. Investors can use it to project future moves and supply and demand, and often employ it to price options contracts."
Import,"An import is a good or service bought in one country that was produced in another. Imports and exports are the components of international trade. If the value of a country's imports exceeds the value of its exports, the country has a negative balance of trade, also known as a trade deficit."
Import Duty,"Import duty is a tax collected on imports and some exports by a country's customs authorities. A good's value will usually dictate the import duty. Depending on the context, import duty may also be known as a customs duty, tariff, import tax or import tariff."
Import Substitution Industrialization,"Import substitution industrialization (ISI) is a theory of economics typically adhered to by developing countries or emerging market nations that seek to decrease their dependence on developed countries. The approach targets the protection and incubation of newly formed domestic industries to fully develop sectors so that the goods produced are competitive with imported goods. Under ISI theory, the process makes local economies, and their nations, self-sufficient."
Impression,"An impression is a metric used to quantify the number of digital views or engagements of a piece of content, usually an advertisement, digital post, or a web page. Impressions are also referred to as an ""ad view."" They are used in online advertising, which often pays on a per-impression basis. Counting impressions is essential to how web advertising is accounted and paid for in search engine marketing, as well as measuring the performance of social media campaigns. Impressions are not a measure of whether an advertisement has been clicked on, but how many times it was displayed or had potential ""eyeballs"" on it, which leads to some debate as to how accurate the metric is."
Imprest,"An imprest is a cash account a business relies on to pay for small, routine expenses. Funds contained in imprests are regularly replenished, in order to maintain a fixed balance. The term “imprest” can also refer to a monetary advance given to a person for a specific purpose."
Impulse Wave Pattern,"An impulse wave pattern is a technical trading term that describes a strong move in a financial asset's price coinciding with the main direction of the underlying trend. It is used frequently in discussion of the Elliott Wave theory, a method for analyzing and predicting financial market price movements. Impulse waves can refer to upward movements in uptrends or downward movements in downtrends."
Imputed Value,"Imputed value, also known as estimated imputation, is an assumed value given to an item when the actual value is not known or available. Imputed values are a logical or implicit value for an item or time set, wherein a ""true"" value has yet to be ascertained."
Imputed Interest,"The IRS uses imputed interest to collect tax revenues on loans or securities that pay little or no interest. Imputed interest is important for discount bonds, such as zero-coupon bonds and other securities sold below face value and mature at par. The IRS uses an accretive method when calculating the imputed interest on Treasury bonds and has applicable federal rates that set a minimum interest rate in relation to imputed interest and original issue discount rules."
In-App Purchasing,"In-app purchasing refers to the buying of goods and services from inside an application on a mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet. In-app purchases allow developers to provide their applications for free. The developer then advertises upgrades to the paid version, paid feature unlocks, special items for sale, or even ads other apps and services to anyone who downloads the free version. This allows the developer to profit despite giving the basic app itself away for free."
In Escrow,"In financial transactions, the term ""in escrow"" indicates a temporary condition of an item, such as money or property, that has been transferred to a third party. This transfer is usually done on behalf of a buyer and seller."
In-House,"In-house refers to conducting an activity or operation within a company, instead of relying on outsourcing. This occurs when a firm uses its own employees and time to keep a division or business activity, such as financing or brokering, in-house."
In-House Financing,"In-house financing is financing in which a firm extends customers a loan, allowing them to purchase its goods or services. In-house financing eliminates the firm's reliance on the financial sector for providing the customer with funds to complete a transaction."
In-Service Withdrawal,"An in-service withdrawal occurs when an employee takes a distribution from a qualified, employer-sponsored retirement plan, such as a 401(k) account, without leaving the employ of their company. This may occur without a tax penalty any time after the employee reaches age 59½, or if the employee withdraws up to $10,000 to purchase their first home, declares a hardship, or establishes extreme financial need."
In Specie,The phrase in specie describes the transfer of an asset in its current form rather than in the equivalent amount of cash. In specie distributions are usually made when cash isn’t readily available or when it’s simply more practical to hand over the asset rather than cash. There also are tax benefits to some in specie transactions.
In the Money (ITM),In the money (ITM) is an expression that refers to an option that possesses intrinsic value. ITM thus indicates that an option has value in a strike price that is favorable in comparison to the prevailing market price of the underlying asset:
Incentive Stock Options (ISOs),"An incentive stock option (ISO) is a corporate benefit that gives an employee the right to buy shares of company stock at a discounted price with the added benefit of possible tax breaks on the profit. The profit on qualified ISOs is usually taxed at the capital gains rate, not the higher rate for ordinary income. Non-qualified stock options (NSOs) are taxed as ordinary income."
Incidence Rate,"The term incidence rate refers to the rate at which a new event occurs over a specified period of time. Put simply, the incidence rate is the number of new cases within a time period (the numerator) as a proportion of the number of people at risk for the disease (the denominator)."
Incidental Expenses (IE),"Incidental expenses, also known as incidentals, are gratuities and other minor fees or costs incurred in addition to the main service, item, or event paid for during business activities."
Income Annuity,"An income annuity is an annuity contract that is designed to start paying income as soon as the policy is initiated. Once funded, an income annuity is annuitized immediately, although the underlying income units may be in either fixed or variable investments. As such, income payments may fluctuate over time."
Income Approach,"The income approach, sometimes referred to as the income capitalization approach, is a type of real estate appraisal method that allows investors to estimate the value of a property based on the income the property generates. It’s used by taking the net operating income (NOI) of the rent collected and dividing it by the capitalization rate."
Income Effect,"In microeconomics, the income effect is the change in demand for a good or service caused by a change in a consumer's purchasing power resulting from a change in real income. This change can be the result of a rise in wages etc., or because existing income is freed up by a decrease or increase in the price of a good that money is being spent on."
Income Elasticity of Demand,"Income elasticity of demand refers to the sensitivity of the quantity demanded for a certain good to a change in real income of consumers who buy this good, keeping all other things constant."
Income from Operations (IFO),"Income from operations (IFO) is also known as operating income or EBIT. Income from operations is the profit realized from a business' own operations. Income from operations is generated from running the primary business and excludes income from other sources. For example, this would exclude income generated from selling the property of a manufacturing company."
Income Fund,"An income fund is a type of mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that emphasizes current income, either on a monthly or quarterly basis, as opposed to capital gains or appreciation. Such funds usually hold a variety of government, municipal, and corporate debt obligations, preferred stock, money market instruments, and dividend-paying stocks."
Income in Respect of a Decedent (IRD),Income in respect of a decedent (IRD) refers to untaxed income that a decedent had earned or had a right to receive during their lifetime. IRD is taxed to the individual beneficiary or entity that inherits this income.
Income Inequality,"Income inequality is how unevenly income is distributed throughout a population. The less equal the distribution, the higher income inequality is. Income inequality is often accompanied by wealth inequality, which is the uneven distribution of wealth. Populations can be divided up in different ways to show different levels and forms of income inequality such as income inequality by sex or race. Different measures, such as the Gini coefficient, can be used to analyze the level of income inequality in a population."
Income Per Capita,Per capita income is a measure of the amount of money earned per person in a nation or geographic region. Per capita income can be used to determine the average per-person income for an area and to evaluate the standard of living and quality of life of the population. Per capita income for a nation is calculated by dividing the country's national income by its population.
Income Property,"An income property refers to a piece of real estate that is purchased or developed primarily in order to earn income by renting or leasing it out to others, with a secondary goal of price appreciation. Income properties, which are a subset of investment properties, may be either residential or commercial."
Income Smoothing,"Income smoothing uses accounting techniques to level out fluctuations in net income from one period to the next. Companies indulge in this practice because investors are generally willing to pay a premium for stocks with steady and predictable earnings streams as opposed to stocks whose earnings are subject to more volatile patterns, which can be regarded as riskier."
Income Statement,"An income statement is one of the three important financial statements used for reporting a company's financial performance over a specific accounting period, with the other two key statements being the balance sheet and the statement of cash flows."
Income Stock,"An income stock is an equity security that pays regular, often steadily increasing dividends. Income stocks usually offer a high yield that may generate the majority of the security's overall returns. While there is no specific breakpoint for classification, most income stocks have lower levels of volatility than the overall stock market, and offer higher-than-market dividend yields."
Income Tax,"The term income tax refers to a type of tax that governments impose on income generated by businesses and individuals within their jurisdiction. By law, taxpayers must file an income tax return annually to determine their tax obligations."
Income Tax Payable,Income tax payable is a type of account in the current liabilities section of a company's balance sheet. It is compiled of taxes due to the government within one year. The calculation of income tax payable is according to the prevailing tax law in the company's home country.
Incontestability Clause,An incontestability clause is a clause in most life insurance policies that prevent the provider from voiding coverage due to a misstatement by the insured after a specific amount of time has passed. A typical incontestability clause specifies that a contract will not be voidable after two or three years due to a misstatement.
Incorporation,Incorporation is the legal process used to form a corporate entity or company. A corporation is the resulting legal entity that separates the firm's assets and income from its owners and investors.
Incoterms,"To facilitate commerce around the world, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) publishes a set of Incoterms, officially known as international commercial terms. Globally recognized, Incoterms prevent confusion in foreign trade contracts by clarifying the obligations of buyers and sellers. Parties involved in domestic and international trade commonly use them as a kind of shorthand to help understand one another and the exact terms of their business arrangements. Some Incoterms apply to any means of transportation; others apply strictly to transportation across water."
Incremental Analysis,"Incremental analysis is a decision-making technique used in business to determine the true cost difference between alternatives. Also called the relevant cost approach, marginal analysis, or differential analysis, incremental analysis disregards any sunk cost or past cost. Incremental analysis is useful for business strategy including the decision to self-produce or outsource a function."
Incremental Capital Output Ratio (ICOR),The incremental capital output ratio (ICOR) is a frequently used tool that explains the relationship between the level of investment made in the economy and the consequent increase in the gross domestic product (GDP). ICOR indicates the additional unit of capital or investment needed to produce an additional unit of output.
Incremental Cost of Capital,Incremental cost of capital is a capital budgeting term that refers to the average cost a company incurs to issue one additional unit of debt or equity. The incremental cost of capital varies according to how many additional units of debt or equity a company wishes to issue. Being able to accurately calculate cost of capital and the incremental effects of issuing more equity or debt can help businesses reduce their overall financing costs.
Incremental Cash Flow,Incremental cash flow is the additional operating cash flow that an organization receives from taking on a new project. A positive incremental cash flow means that the company's cash flow will increase with the acceptance of the project. A positive incremental cash flow is a good indication that an organization should invest in a project.
Incremental Cost,"Incremental cost is the total cost incurred due to an additional unit of product being produced. Incremental cost is calculated by analyzing the additional expenses involved in the production process, such as raw materials, for one additional unit of production. Understanding incremental costs can help companies boost production efficiency and profitability."
Incumbency Certificate,"An incumbency certificate (or certificate of incumbency) is an official document issued by a corporation or limited liability company (LLC) that lists the names of its current directors, officers, and, occasionally, key shareholders. It specifies who holds which positions within the organization, and is most frequently used to confirm the identity of individuals who are authorized to enter into legally binding transactions on the company's behalf."
Incumbent,"The term incumbent refers to an individual who currently holds a set of responsibilities within a specific office as part of a corporation or within a branch of the government. As the incumbent, this person has an obligation to the position or office they hold.

Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR),"Incurred but not reported (IBNR) is a type of reserve account used in the insurance industry as the provision for claims and/or events that have transpired, but have not yet been reported to an insurance company."
Indemnity Insurance,The term indemnity insurance refers to an insurance policy that compensates an insured party for certain unexpected damages or losses up to a certain limit—usually the amount of the loss itself. Insurance companies provide coverage in exchange for premiums paid by the insured parties. These policies are commonly designed to protect professionals and business owners when they are found to be at fault for a specific event such as misjudgment or malpractice. They generally take the form of a letter of indemnity.
Indenture,"Indenture refers to a legal and binding agreement, contract, or document between two or more parties. Traditionally, these documents featured indented sides or perforated edges. Historically, indenture has also referred to a contract binding one person to work for another for a set period of time (indentured servant), particularly European immigrants. In modern day finance, the word indenture most commonly appears in bond agreements, real estate deals, and some aspects of bankruptcies."
Indentured Servitude,"Indentured servitude refers to a contract between two individuals, in which one person worked not for money but to repay an indenture, or loan, within a set time period. Indentured servitude was popular in the United States in the 1600s as individuals, mainly European immigrants, worked in exchange for the price of passage to America."
Independent Contractor,"An independent contractor is a self-employed person or entity contracted to perform work for—or provide services to—another entity as a nonemployee. As a result, independent contractors must pay their own Social Security and Medicare taxes. In addition, an entity that uses the services of an independent contractor is not required to provide them with employment benefits, such as health insurance and employer-sponsored retirement accounts, that the entity might otherwise provide were the contractor an employee. The payer must correctly classify each payee as either an independent contractor or employee. Another term for an independent contractor is “freelancer.”"
Index,"An index is a method to track the performance of a group of assets in a standardized way. Indexes typically measure the performance of a basket of securities intended to replicate a certain area of the market. These could be a broad-based index that captures the entire market, such as the Standard & Poor's 500 Index or Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), or more specialized such as indexes that track a particular industry or segment."
Index Fund,"An index fund is a type of mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) with a portfolio constructed to match or track the components of a financial market index, such as the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500). An index mutual fund is said to provide broad market exposure, low operating expenses, and low portfolio turnover. These funds follow their benchmark index regardless of the state of the markets."
Index Investing,"Index investing is a passive investment technique that attempts to generate returns similar to a broad market index. Investors use this buy-and-hold strategy to replicate the performance of a specific index—generally an equity or fixed-income index—by purchasing the component securities of the index, or investing in an index mutual fund or exchange traded fund (ETF) that itself closely tracks the underlying index."
Index-Linked Bond,"An index-linked bond is a bond in which payment of interest income on the principal is related to a specific price index, usually the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This feature provides protection to investors by shielding them from changes in the underlying index. The bond's cash flows are adjusted to ensure that the holder of the bond receives a known real rate of return. An index-linked bond is also known as a real return bond in Canada, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) in the U.S., and a linker in the U.K."
Indexation,"Indexation is a system or technique used by organizations or governments to connect prices and asset values. This is done by linking adjustments made to the value of a good, price of a service, or another specified value to a predetermined price or composite index.

A lease provides the lessee with limited right-to-use without transferring ownership in return for payment to the lessor."
Lease Rate,"A lease rate is the amount of money paid over a specified time period for the rental of an asset, such as real property or an automobile. The lease rate that the lessor earns from allowing someone else to use their property compensates them for not being able to use that property during the term of the lease."
Leaseback,"A leaseback is an arrangement in which the company that sells an asset can lease back that same asset from the purchaser. With a leaseback—also called a sale-leaseback—the details of the arrangement, such as the lease payments and lease duration, are made immediately after the sale of the asset. In a sale-leaseback transaction, the seller of the asset becomes the lessee and the purchaser becomes the lessor."
Leasehold,A leasehold is an accounting term for an asset being leased. The asset is typically property such as a building or space in a building. The lessee contracts with the lessor for the right to use the property in exchange for a series of scheduled payments over the term of the lease. Renting space in an office building for a company's use or renting a building to be used for a retail store are two examples of a commercial leasehold arrangement.

These changes and alterations may include painting, installing partitions, changing the flooring, or putting in customized light fixtures. Improvements may be undertaken by the landlord or the tenant and may be paid by the tenant. While the useful economic life of most leasehold improvements is anywhere between five and 10 years, the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) requires that depreciation for such improvements to occur over the economic life of the building."

Legal Rate of Interest,"The legal rate of interest is the highest rate of interest that can be legally charged on any type of debt, and to which a lender must adhere. The legal rate of interest applies to all types of debt, although certain types of debt may carry a higher legal rate than another—for instance, the legal limit for a payday lender may be higher than the legal limit for a student loan. The limit is set to prevent lenders from charging borrowers excessive interest rates."

Letter of Comfort,"A letter of comfort—also known as a letter of intent or a solvency opinion—is a written document that provides a level of assurance that an obligation will ultimately be met. In its traditional context, a letter of comfort is given to organizations or persons of interest by external auditors regarding statutory audits, statements, and reports used in a prospectus. The letter of comfort will be attached to the preliminary statements as assurance that it will not be materially different from the final version."
Letter of Credit,"A letter of credit, or ""credit letter"" is a letter from a bank guaranteeing that a buyer's payment to a seller will be received on time and for the correct amount. In the event that the buyer is unable to make a payment on the purchase, the bank will be required to cover the full or remaining amount of the purchase. It may be offered as a facility."
Letter of Guarantee,"A letter of guarantee is a type of contract issued by a bank on behalf of a customer who has entered a contract to purchase goods from a supplier. The letter of guarantee lets the supplier know that they will be paid, even if the customer of the bank defaults.

Letter of Indemnity,"A letter of indemnity (LOI) is a contractual document that guarantees certain provisions will be met between two parties. Such letters are traditionally drafted by third-party institutions like banks or insurance companies, which agree to pay financial restitution to one of the parties, should the other party fail to live up to its obligations. In other words, the chief function of an LOI is to ensure that Party A won't ultimately suffer any losses if Party B falls delinquent. The concept of indemnity has to do with holding someone harmless, and a letter of indemnity outlines the specific measures that will be used to hold a party harmless."
Letter of Intent (LOI),"A letter of intent (LOI) is a document declaring the preliminary commitment of one party to do business with another. The letter outlines the chief terms of a prospective deal. Commonly used in major business transactions, LOIs are similar in content to term sheets.

Level 1,"Level 1 is a type of trading screen used with stock trading that displays the best bid-offer-volume quotes in real-time, or the national best bid and offer (NBBO). Level 1 quotes supply basic information that, for the most part, is more than sufficient for most investors, though some extremely active traders prefer order book and market depth information that can be found in higher-level quotes."
Level 2,"First introduced in 1983 as the Nasdaq Quotation Dissemination Service (NQDS), Level 2 is a subscription-based service that provides real-time access to the NASDAQ order book. It is intended to display market depth and momentum to traders and investors.﻿﻿"
Level 3,"A level III quote is pricing information about a security provided by a trading service. It includes the real-time bid price, ask price, quote size, price of the last trade, size of the last trade, high price for the day, and the low price for the day. Level III gives institutions the ability to enter quotes, execute orders, and send information. Because the level III service offers a high level of market depth, it is restricted to registered Nasdaq market makers."
Level 1 Assets,"Level 1 assets include listed stocks, bonds, funds, or any assets that have a regular mark-to-market mechanism for setting a fair market value. These assets are considered to have a readily observable, transparent prices, and therefore a reliable fair market value."
Level 2 Assets,"Level 2 assets are financial assets and liabilities that are difficult to value. Although a fair value can be determined based on other data values or market prices, these assets do not have regular market pricing. Level 2 asset values, sometimes called ""mark-to-model"" assets, can be closely approximated using simple models and extrapolation methods. These methods use known, observable prices as parameters."
Level 3 Assets,"Level 3 assets are financial assets and liabilities considered to be the most illiquid and hardest to value. They are not traded frequently, so it is difficult to give them a reliable and accurate market price."
Level Death,"A level death benefit is a payout from a life insurance policy that is the same regardless of whether the insured person dies shortly after purchasing the policy or many years later. It can be contrasted with an increasing death benefit, which rises in value over time as the policyholder ages."
Level-Premium Insurance,"Level-premium insurance is a type of term life insurance. With this type of coverage, premiums are guaranteed to remain the same throughout the contract, while the amount of coverage provided increases. As a result, the coverage can be advantageous over a long period of time: a policyholder keeps paying the same amount but has access to increased benefit coverage as the policy matures."
Leverage,"Leverage results from using borrowed capital as a funding source when investing to expand the firm's asset base and generate returns on risk capital. Leverage is an investment strategy of using borrowed money—specifically, the use of various financial instruments or borrowed capital—to increase the potential return of an investment.

Leveraged Buyback,"A leveraged buyback, also known as a leveraged share repurchase, is a corporate finance transaction that enables a company to repurchase some of its shares using debt. By reducing the number of shares outstanding, it increases the remaining owners' respective shares."
Leveraged Buyout (LBO),"A leveraged buyout (LBO) is the acquisition of another company using a significant amount of borrowed money to meet the cost of acquisition. The assets of the company being acquired are often used as collateral for the loans, along with the assets of the acquiring company."
Leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan (LESOP),"A leveraged employee stock ownership plan (LESOP) is an employee compensation program in which the sponsoring company leverages its own credit and borrows the money used to fund the plan and purchase shares from the company's treasury. These shares are then used for the stock ownership plan (ESOP), with the company subsequently paying back the original loan with annual contributions."
Leveraged ETF,"A leveraged exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a marketable security that uses financial derivatives and debt to amplify the returns of an underlying index. While a traditional exchange-traded fund typically tracks the securities in its underlying index on a one-to-one basis, a leveraged ETF may aim for a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio."
Leveraged Lease,"A leveraged lease is a lease agreement that is financed through the lessor with help from a third-party financial institution. In a leveraged lease, an asset is rented with borrowed funds."
Leveraged Loan,"A leveraged loan is a type of loan that is extended to companies or individuals that already have considerable amounts of debt or poor credit history. Lenders consider leveraged loans to carry a higher risk of default, and as a result, a leveraged loan is more costly to the borrower. Default occurs when a borrower can't make any payments for an extended period. Leveraged loans for companies or individuals with debt tend to have higher interest rates than typical loans. These rates reflect the higher level of risk involved in issuing the loans."
Leveraged Loan Index (LLI),"A leveraged loan index (LLI) is a market-weighted index that tracks the performance of institutional leveraged loans. Several indexes for the market exist, but the most widely followed one is the S&P/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index."
Leveraged Recapitalization,"A leveraged recapitalization is a corporate finance transaction in which a company changes its capitalization structure by replacing the majority of its equity with a package of debt securities consisting of both senior bank debt and subordinated debt. A leveraged recapitalization is also referred to as leveraged recap. In other words, the company will borrow money in order to buy back shares that were previously issued, and reduce the amount of equity in its capital structure. Senior managers/employees may receive additional equity, in order to align their interests with the bondholders and shareholders."
Levered Free Cash Flow (LFCF),"Levered free cash flow (LFCF) is the amount of money a company has left remaining after paying all of its financial obligations. LFCF is the amount of cash a company has after paying debts, while unlevered free cash flow (UFCF) is cash before debt payments are made. Levered free cash flow is important because it is the amount of cash that a company can use to pay dividends and make investments in the business."
Levy,A levy is the legal seizure of property to satisfy an outstanding debt.

Liability Driven Investment (LDI),"A liability-driven investment, otherwise known as liability-driven investing, is primarily slated toward gaining enough assets to cover all current and future liabilities. This type of investing is common when dealing with defined-benefit pension plans because the liabilities involved quite frequently climb into billions of dollars with the largest of the pension plans.﻿﻿"
Liability Insurance,"The term liability insurance refers to an insurance product that provides an insured party with protection against claims resulting from injuries and damage to other people or property. Liability insurance policies cover any legal costs and payouts an insured party is responsible for if they are found legally liable. Intentional damage and contractual liabilities are generally not covered in liability insurance policies. Unlike other types of insurance, liability insurance policies pay third parties—not policyholders."
Liar Loan,"A liar loan is a category of mortgage loan that requires little or no documentation of income. Because the lender does not verify income and assets by looking at W-2 forms, income tax returns and other records, such loans are said to be ""liar loans"" because lenders simply take the borrower at their word."
Liar's Poker,Liar's Poker is a game often associated with Wall Street traders. The game involves wagering on the aggregate amount of numbers appearing on the serial numbers of players' dollar bills.
Libel,"Libel involves the act of publishing a statement about an individual, either in written form or broadcast over media platforms such as radio, television, or the Internet, that is untrue and threatens to harm the reputation and/or livelihood of the targeted person.

The theory is that individuals seek to smooth consumption throughout their lifetime by borrowing when their income is low and saving when their income is high.
Life Estate,"A life estate is property, usually a residence, that an individual owns and may use for the duration of their lifetime. This person, called the life tenant, shares ownership of the property with another person or persons, who will automatically receive the title to the property upon the death of the life tenant."

There are many uses for it in the financial world, including life insurance, pension planning, and U.S. Social Security benefits. In most countries, the calculations for this actuarial age is derived from a national statistical agency based on large amounts of data."
Life Income Fund (LIF),"A life income fund (LIF) is a type of registered retirement income fund (RRIF) offered in Canada that can be used to hold locked-in pension funds as well as other assets for eventual payout as retirement income. A life income fund cannot be withdrawn in a lump sum. Owners must use the fund in a manner that supports retirement income for their lifetime. Each year's Income Tax Act specifies the minimum and maximum withdrawal amounts for RRIFs, which encompasses LIFs. The Income Tax Act’s RRIF stipulations take into consideration fund balances and an annuity factor."
Life Insurance,"Life insurance is a contract between an insurer and a policyholder. A life insurance policy guarantees the insurer pays a sum of money to named beneficiaries when the insured policyholder dies, in exchange for the premiums paid by the policyholder during their lifetime."
Life Settlement,"A life settlement refers to the sale of an existing insurance policy to a third party for a one-time cash payment. Payment is more than the surrender value but less than the actual death benefit. After the sale, the purchaser becomes the policy's beneficiary and assumes payment of its premiums.

Lightning Network,"The lightning network is a second layer technology applied to bitcoin that uses micropayment channels to scale its blockchain’s capability to conduct transactions more efficiently. Transactions conducted on lightning networks are faster, less costly, and more readily confirmed than those conducted directly on the bitcoin blockchain (i.e., on-chain)."
Like-for-Like Sales,Like-for-like sales are used as an adjusted growth metric that includes revenues generated from stores or products with similar characteristics while omitting any with distinct differences that could skew the numbers.

Limited Liability,"Limited liability is a type of legal structure for an organization where a corporate loss will not exceed the amount invested in a partnership or limited liability company (LLC). In other words, investors' and owners' private assets are not at risk if the company fails. In Germany, it's known as Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung (GmbH)."
Limited Liability Company (LLC),A limited liability company (LLC) is a business structure in the United States whereby the owners are not personally liable for the company's debts or liabilities. Limited liability companies are hybrid entities that combine the characteristics of a corporation with those of a partnership or sole proprietorship.﻿﻿
Limited Partner,A limited partner is a part-owner of a company whose liability for the firm's debts cannot exceed the amount that an individual invested in the company. Limited partners are often called silent partners.
Limited Partnership (LP),"A limited partnership (LP)—not to be confused with a limited liability partnership (LLP)—is a partnership made up of two or more partners. The general partner oversees and runs the business while limited partners do not partake in managing the business. However, the general partner of a limited partnership has unlimited liability for the debt, and any limited partners have limited liability up to the amount of their investment."
Limited Partnership Unit (LPU),"A limited partnership unit, or LPU, is an ownership unit in a publicly traded limited partnership, or master limited partnership (MLP). This trust gives the unit holder a stake in the income generated by the partnership company. A limited partnership unit is also referred to as a master limited partnership unit or a limited partner unit."
Limited Power of Attorney (LPOA),"Limited Power of Attorney (LPOA) is an authorization that permits a portfolio manager to perform specific functions on behalf of the account owner. In general, the LPOA allows the manager to execute an agreed-upon investment strategy and take care of routine related business without contacting the account holder."
Lindahl Equilibrium,"Lindahl equilibrium is a state of equilibrium in a quasi-market for a pure public good. Like a competitive market equilibrium, the supply and demand for the good are balanced, in addition to the cost and revenue to produce the good. Lindahl equilibrium depends on the possibility of implementing an effective Lindahl tax, first proposed by the Swedish economist Erik Lindahl."
Line Chart,"A line chart is a graphical representation of an asset's historical price action that connects a series of data points with a continuous line. This is the most basic type of chart used in finance, and it typically only depicts a security's closing prices over time. Line charts can be used for any timeframe, but they most often make use of day-to-day price changes."
Line Graph,A line graph—also known as a line plot or a line chart—is a graph that uses lines to connect individual data points. A line graph displays quantitative values over a specified time interval.
Line of Best Fit,"Line of best fit refers to a line through a scatter plot of data points that best expresses the relationship between those points. Statisticians typically use the least squares method to arrive at the geometric equation for the line, either though manual calculations or regression analysis software. A straight line will result from a simple linear regression analysis of two or more independent variables. A regression involving multiple related variables can produce a curved line in some cases."
Line of Business Limitations,"Line of business limitations is a federal income tax rule applied to fringe benefits that employers provide their employees. It states that if a company is engaged in multiple lines of business and an employee receives a fringe benefit from a line of the company's business that she does not work in, she must pay taxes on that benefit.﻿﻿"
Line of Credit (LOC),"A line of credit (LOC) is a preset borrowing limit that can be tapped into at any time. The borrower can take money out as needed until the limit is reached, and as money is repaid, it can be borrowed again in the case of an open line of credit."
Linear Relationship,"A linear relationship (or linear association) is a statistical term used to describe a straight-line relationship between two variables. Linear relationships can be expressed either in a graphical format where the variable and the constant are connected via a straight line or in a mathematical format where the independent variable is multiplied by the slope coefficient, added by a constant, which determines the dependent variable."
Linearly Weighted Moving Average (LWMA),"A linearly weighted moving average (LWMA) is a moving average calculation that more heavily weights recent price data. The most recent price has the highest weighting, and each prior price has progressively less weight. The weights drop in a linear fashion. LWMAs are quicker to react to price changes than simple moving averages (SMA) and exponential moving averages (EMA)."
Linked Savings Account,"A linked savings account is a savings account that is connected to another account such as a checking or negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) account. Generally, linked savings accounts are held at the same bank as the customer's other accounts, making it easier to transfer funds between accounts."
Lintner's Model,The Lintner model is an economic formula for determining an optimal corporate dividend policy. It was proposed in 1956 by former Harvard Business School professor John Lintner and focuses on two core notions:
Liquid Alternatives,"Liquid alternative investments (or liquid alts) are mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that aim to provide investors with diversification and downside protection through exposure to alternative investment strategies. These products' selling point is that they are liquid, meaning that they can be bought and sold daily, unlike traditional alternatives which offer monthly or quarterly liquidity. They come with lower minimum investments than the typical hedge fund, and investors don't have to pass net-worth or income requirements to invest."
Liquid Asset,"A liquid asset is an asset that can easily be converted into cash in a short amount of time. Liquid assets include things like cash, money market instruments, and marketable securities. Both individuals and businesses can be concerned with tracking liquid assets as a portion of their net worth. For the purposes of financial accounting, a company’s liquid assets are reported on its balance sheet as current assets."
Liquid Market,"A liquid market a one with many available buyers and sellers and comparatively low transaction costs. The details of what makes a market liquid may vary depending on the asset being exchanged. In a liquid market, it is easy to execute a trade quickly and at a desirable price because there are numerous buyers and sellers and the product being exchanged is standardized and in high demand. In a liquid market despite daily changes in supply and demand the spread between what the buyer wants to pay and what sellers will offer remains relatively small."
Liquidate,Liquidate means converting property or assets into cash or cash equivalents by selling them on the open market. Liquidation similarly refers to the process of bringing a business to an end and distributing its assets to claimants.
Liquidated Damages,Liquidated damages are presented in certain legal contracts as an estimate of otherwise intangible or hard-to-define losses to one of the parties. It is a provision that allows for the payment of a specified sum should one of the parties be in breach of contract.
Liquidating Dividend,"A liquidating dividend is a type of payment that a corporation makes to its shareholders during a partial or full liquidation. For the most part, this form of distribution is made from the company's capital base. As a return of capital, this distribution is typically not taxable for shareholders. A liquidating dividend is distinguished from regular dividends that are issued from the company's operating profits or retained earnings."
Liquidation,"Liquidation in finance and economics is the process of bringing a business to an end and distributing its assets to claimants. It is an event that usually occurs when a company is insolvent, meaning it cannot pay its obligations when they are due. As company operations end, the remaining assets are used to pay creditors and shareholders, based on the priority of their claims. General partners are subject to liquidation."
Liquidation Margin,The liquidation margin is the value of all of the positions in a margin account. These can include both long and short positions.
Liquidation Preference,"A liquidation preference is a clause in a contract that dictates the payout order in case of a corporate liquidation. Typically, the company's investors or preferred stockholders get their money back first, ahead of other kinds of stockholders or debtholders, in the event that the company must be liquidated. Liquidation preferences are frequently used in venture capital contracts, hybrid debt instruments, promissory notes and other structured private capital transactions, to clarify what investors get paid and in which order during a liquidation event, such as the sale of the company."""
Liquidation Value,"Liquidation value is the net value of a company's physical assets if it were to go out of business and the assets sold. The liquidation value is the value of company real estate, fixtures, equipment, and inventory. Intangible assets are excluded from a company's liquidation value."
Liquidator,"A liquidator is a person or entity that liquidates something—generally assets. When assets are liquidated, they are sold on the open market for cash or other equivalents. The liquidator is legally empowered to act on behalf of the company in various capacities."
Liquidity,Liquidity refers to the efficiency or ease with which an asset or security can be converted into ready cash without affecting its market price. The most liquid asset of all is cash itself.
Liquidity Adjustment Facility,"A liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) is a tool used in monetary policy, primarily by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that allows banks to borrow money through repurchase agreements (repos) or to make loans to the RBI through reverse repo agreements. This arrangement is effective in managing liquidity pressures and assuring basic stability in the financial markets. In the United States, the Federal Reserve transacts repos and reverse repos under its open market operations."
Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR),"The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) refers to the proportion of highly liquid assets held by financial institutions, to ensure their ongoing ability to meet short-term obligations. This ratio is essentially a generic stress test that aims to anticipate market-wide shocks and make sure that financial institutions possess suitable capital preservation, to ride out any short-term liquidity disruptions, that may plague the market."
Liquidity Crisis,A liquidity crisis is a financial situation characterized by a lack of cash or easily-convertible-to-cash assets on hand across many businesses or financial institutions simultaneously.
Liquidity Event,"A liquidity event is an acquisition, merger, initial public offering (IPO), or other action that allows founders and early investors in a company to cash out some or all of their ownership shares."
Liquidity Ratio,"Liquidity ratios are an important class of financial metrics used to determine a debtor's ability to pay off current debt obligations without raising external capital. Liquidity ratios measure a company's ability to pay debt obligations and its margin of safety through the calculation of metrics including the current ratio, quick ratio, and operating cash flow ratio."
Liquidity Trap,"A liquidity trap is a contradictory economic situation in which interest rates are very low and savings rates are high, rendering monetary policy ineffective. First described by economist John Maynard Keynes, during a liquidity trap, consumers choose to avoid bonds and keep their funds in cash savings because of the prevailing belief that interest rates could soon rise (which would push bond prices down). Because bonds have an inverse relationship to interest rates, many consumers do not want to hold an asset with a price that is expected to decline. At the same time, central bank efforts to spur economic activity are hampered as they are unable to lower interest rates further to incentivize investors and consumers."
Liquified Natural Gas (LNG),"Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas that has been converted to a liquid form for the ease and safety of natural gas transport. Natural gas is cooled to approximately -260 F, creating a clear, colorless, and non-toxic liquid that can be transported from areas with a large supply of natural gas to areas that demand more natural gas."
Lis Pendens,"A lis pendens is an official notice to the public that a lawsuit involving a claim on a property has been filed. Lis pendens is connected to the concept that a buyer of a property must assume any litigation that exists pertaining to the property. If a bank is suing the owner of a lot and a new buyer purchases the lot, then the new owner must face the lawsuit; sale of the property does not prevent the plaintiff from seeking redress via litigation. It can represent a contingent liability."
Lisbon Treaty,"The Lisbon Treaty, also known as the Treaty of Lisbon, updated regulations for the European Union, establishing a more centralized leadership and foreign policy, a proper process for countries that wish to leave the Union, and a streamlined process for enacting new policies."
Listed,Listed describes companies that are included and traded on a given stock exchange. Most exchanges have specific requirements that companies must meet in order to be listed and continue to stay listed.
Listed Option,"A listed option, or exchange-traded option, is a type of derivative security traded on a registered exchange. Listed options give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specific amount of the underlying asset at a fixed price by a particular date."
Listed Property,"The term listed property refers to a certain type of depreciable property that may be used primarily for business purposes. To be considered listed property, an item must be used for more than 50% for a company's business. That means assets may be used for personal purposes for the remainder of the time. Listed property is subject to a special set of tax rules for the taxpayer.﻿﻿"
Listed Security,"A listed security is a financial instrument that is traded through an exchange, such as the NYSE or Nasdaq. When a private company decides to go public and issue shares, it will need to choose an exchange on which to be listed. To do so, it must be able to meet that exchange's listing requirements and pay both the exchange's entry and yearly listing fees. Listing requirements vary by exchange and include minimum stockholder's equity, a minimum share price, and a minimum number of shareholders. Exchanges have listing requirements to ensure that only high-quality securities are traded on them and to uphold the exchange's reputation among investors."
Listing Agreement,"A listing agreement is a contract under which a property owner (as principal) authorizes a real estate broker (as agent) to find a buyer for the property on the owner's terms, for which service the owner pays a commission set forth in the agreement."
Listing Requirements,"Listing requirements comprise the various criteria and minimum standards established by stock exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange, to allow membership in the exchange. Only if an exchange's listing requirements are met can a company list shares for trading."
Living Trust,"A living trust is a legal document, or trust, created during an individual's lifetime where a designated person, the trustee, is given responsibility for managing that individual's assets for the benefit of the eventual beneficiary. A living trust is designed to allow for the easy transfer of the trust creator or settlor's assets while bypassing the often complex and expensive legal process of probate. Living trust agreements designate a trustee who holds legal possession of assets and property that flow into the trust."
Living Wage,"A living wage refers to a theoretical income level that allows individuals or families to afford adequate shelter, food, and other necessities. The goal of a living wage is to allow employees to earn enough income for a satisfactory standard of living and prevent them from falling into poverty."
Living Will,A living will—also known as an advance directive—is a legal document that specifies the type of medical care that an individual does or does not want in the event they are unable to communicate their wishes.
LLC Operating Agreement,An LLC operating agreement is a document that customizes the terms of a limited liability company according to the specific needs of its owners. It also outlines the financial and functional decision-making in a structured manner. It is similar to articles of incorporation that govern the operations of a corporation.
Lloyd's Of London,"Lloyd's of London is a British insurance market where members operate as syndicates to insure and spread out the risks of different businesses, organizations, and individuals. The syndicates are specialized in different types of risks and each syndicate decides which type of risk to insure. The main purpose of Lloyd's of London is to act as an intermediary between clients, underwriters, brokers, and insurance companies."
Load,A load is a sales charge or commission charged to an investor when buying or redeeming shares in a mutual fund. Sales charge commissions can be structured in a number of ways. They are determined by the mutual fund company and charged by mutual fund intermediaries in mutual fund transactions.
Load Fund,"A load fund is a mutual fund that comes with a sales charge or commission. The fund investor pays the load, which goes to compensate a sales intermediary, such as a broker, financial planner or investment advisor, for his time and expertise in selecting an appropriate fund for the investor. The load is either paid up front at the time of purchase (front-end load), when the shares are sold (back-end load), or as long as the fund is held by the investor (level-load)."
Loan,"The term loan refers to a type of credit vehicle in which a sum of money is lent to another party in exchange for future repayment of the value or principal amount. In many cases, the lender also adds interest and/or finance charges to the principal value which the borrower must repay in addition to the principal balance. Loans may be for a specific, one-time amount, or they may be available as an open-ended line of credit up to a specified limit. Loans come in many different forms including secured, unsecured, commercial, and personal loans."
Loan Application Fee,"A loan application fee is charged to a potential borrower for processing and underwriting an application for a loan, such as a mortgage or car loan. Loan application fees may be required for all types of loans and are intended to pay for the costs of the process of loan approval, but are considered by many observers to be unnecessary or overly costly."
Loan Commitment,A loan commitment is an agreement by a commercial bank or other financial institution to lend a business or individual a specified sum of money. A loan commitment is useful for consumers looking to buy a home or a business planning to make a major purchase.
Loan Committee,"A loan committee is the lending or management committee of a bank or other lending institution. It generally consists of upper-level officers with management authority. The loan committee analyzes and subsequently approves or rejects any loan that the initial loan officer does not have the authority to approve, typically those of large sizes or higher risk. The committee ensures that the loan meets the institution’s standard lending policy. If it does, the committee can agree to fund and disburse the loan with a binding commitment."
Loan Constant,"A loan constant is a percentage that shows the annual debt service on a loan compared to its total principal value. The calculation for a loan constant is the annual debt service divided by the total loan amount. When shopping for a loan, borrowers can compare the loan constant of various loans before making a decision. The loan with the lowest loan constant will have lower debt service requirements, meaning the borrower will pay less in interest and principal over a given period. Loan constants are only applicable to fixed interest rate loans and not loans with variable interest rates."
Loan Credit Default Swap (LCDS),"A loan credit default swap (LCDS) is a type of credit derivative in which the credit exposure of an underlying loan is exchanged between two parties. A loan credit default swap's structure is the same as a regular credit default swap (CDS), except that the underlying reference obligation is limited strictly to syndicated secured loans, rather than any type of corporate debt."
Loan Credit Default Swap Index (Markit LCDX),"The Loan Credit Default Swap Index (Markit LCDX) is a specialized index of loan-only credit default swaps (CDS) covering 100 North American companies with unsecured debt trading in broad secondary markets. The LCDX is traded over-the-counter, and several large investment banks manage it, provide liquidity, and assist in pricing individual credit default swaps. IHS Markit Ltd, headquartered in London, is the index provider."
Loan Grading,"Loan grading is a classification system that involves assigning a quality score to a loan based on a borrower's credit history, quality of the collateral, and the likelihood of repayment of the principal and interest. A score can also be applied to a portfolio of loans. Loan grading is part of a lending institution's loan review or credit risk system and is usually an aspect of the credit underwriting and approval processes."
Loan Life Coverage Ratio (LLCR),"The loan life coverage ratio (LLCR) is a financial ratio used to estimate the solvency of a firm, or the ability of a borrowing company to repay an outstanding loan. LLCR is calculated by dividing the net present value (NPV) of the money available for debt repayment by the amount of outstanding debt."
Loan Lock,A loan lock refers to a lender’s promise to offer a borrower a specified interest rate on a mortgage and to hold that rate for an agreed-upon period of time.
Loan Loss Provision,"A loan loss provision is an income statement expense set aside as an allowance for uncollected loans and loan payments. This provision is used to cover different kinds of loan losses such as non-performing loans, customer bankruptcy, and renegotiated loans that incur lower-than-previously-estimated payments. Loan loss provisions are then added to the loan loss reserves, a balance sheet item that represents the total amount of loan losses subtracted a company's loans.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿"
Loan Modification,"Loan modification is a change made to the terms of an existing loan by a lender. It may involve a reduction in the interest rate, an extension of the length of time for repayment, a different type of loan, or any combination of the three."
Loan Note,"A loan note is an extended form of a generic I Owe You (IOU) document from one party to another. It enables a payee (borrower) to receive payments from a lender, possibly with an interest rate attached, over a set period of time, and ending on the date at which the entire loan is to be repaid. Loan notes are usually provided in lieu of cash at the payee's request."
Loan Officer,"A loan officer is a representative of a bank, credit union, or other financial institution who assists borrowers in the application process. Loan officers are often called mortgage loan officers since that is the most complex and costly type of loan most consumers encounter. However, most loan officers assist consumers and small business owners with a wide variety of secured and unsecured loans."
Loan Participation Note (LPN),"A loan participation note (LPN) is a fixed-income security that permits investors to buy portions of an outstanding loan or package of loans. LPN holders participate on a pro-rata basis in collecting interest and principal payments, and are similarly exposed to a proportional risk of default."
Loan Production Office (LPO),"A loan production office (LPO) is an administrative division of a bank, that, as the name implies, deals solely with loan-related activities. The Federal Reserve defines an LPO as “a staffed facility, other than a branch, which is open to the public and provides lending-related services such as loan information and applications.”"
Loan Servicing,"Loan servicing refers to the administrative aspects of a loan from the time the proceeds are dispersed to the borrower until the loan is paid off. Loan servicing includes sending monthly payment statements, collecting monthly payments, maintaining records of payments and balances, collecting and paying taxes and insurance (and managing escrow funds), remitting funds to the note holder, and following up any delinquencies."
Loan Shark,"A loan shark is a person who – or an entity that – loans money at extremely high interest rates and often uses threats of violence to collect debts. The interest rates are generally well above an established legal rate, and often loan sharks are members of organized crime groups."
Loan Stock,"Loan stock refers to shares of common or preferred stock that are used as collateral to secure a loan from another party. The loan earns a fixed interest rate, much like a standard loan, and can be secured or unsecured. A secured loan stock may also be called a convertible loan stock if the loan stock can be directly converted to common shares under specified conditions and with a predetermined conversion rate, as with an irredeemable convertible unsecured loan stock (ICULS)."
Loan Syndication,"Loan syndication is the process of involving a group of lenders in funding various portions of a loan for a single borrower. Loan syndication most often occurs when a borrower requires an amount too large for a single lender to provide or when the loan is outside the scope of a lender's risk exposure levels. Thus, multiple lenders form a syndicate to provide the borrower with the requested capital."
Loan-to-Cost Ratio (LTC),"The loan-to-cost (LTC) ratio is a metric used in commercial real estate construction to compare the financing of a project (as offered by a loan) with the cost of building the project. The LTC ratio allows commercial real estate lenders to determine the risk of offering a construction loan. It also allows developers to understand the amount of equity they retain during a construction project. Similar to the LTC ratio, the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio also compares the construction loan amount but with the fair-market value of the project after completion."
Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR),"The loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) is used to assess a bank's liquidity by comparing a bank's total loans to its total deposits for the same period. The LDR is expressed as a percentage. If the ratio is too high, it means that the bank may not have enough liquidity to cover any unforeseen fund requirements. Conversely, if the ratio is too low, the bank may not be earning as much as it could be."
Loan-to-Value (LTV),"The loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is an assessment of lending risk that financial institutions and other lenders examine before approving a mortgage. Typically, loan assessments with high LTV ratios are considered higher risk loans. Therefore, if the mortgage is approved, the loan has a higher interest rate."
Lobby,"The term lobby refers to a group of people who band together and try to influence people in public office and politicians. A lobby is typically formed to influence government officials to act in a way that is beneficial to the lobby's or an industry's best interests, either through favorable legislation or by blocking unfavorable measures. The term is also used as a verb to describe the influence that a group of individuals exerts over other people."
Local Tax,"A local tax is an assessment by a state, county, or municipality to fund public services ranging from education to garbage collection and sewer maintenance. Local taxes come in many forms, from property taxes and payroll taxes to sales taxes and licensing fees. They can vary widely from one jurisdiction to the next."
Lock In Profits,"Locking in profits refers to the realization of previously unrealized gains accrued in a security by closing all or a portion of the holdings. When an investor holds an open position, they may accrue unrealized or paper gains or losses that aren't realized until the position is closed. An example is when an investor that's long on a security can lock in profits by selling their stake for a gain. By doing this they are no longer subject to changes in the underlying."
Lock-Up Agreement,A lock-up agreement is a contractual provision preventing insiders of a company from selling their shares for a specified period of time. They are commonly used as part of the initial public offering (IPO) process.
Lock-Up Period,"A lock-up period is a window of time when investors are not allowed to redeem or sell shares of a particular investment. There are two main uses for lock-up periods, those for hedge funds and those for start-ups/IPO’s."
Lockbox Banking,"Lockbox banking is a service provided by banks to companies for the receipt of payment from customers. Under the service, the payments made by customers are directed to a special post office box instead of going to the company. The bank goes to the box, retrieves the payments, processes them and deposits the funds directly into the company's bank account."
Locked In,"The phrase ""locked in"" describes a situation wherein an investor is unwilling or unable to trade a security because of regulations, taxes or penalties associated with doing so. This may occur in be an investment vehicle, such as a retirement plan, that an employee may not access before a specified retirement date."
Locked-In Retirement Account (LIRA),"A Locked-in Retirement Account (LIRA) is a type of registered pension fund in Canada that does not permit withdrawals before retirement except in exceptional circumstances. The locked-in retirement account is designed to hold pension funds for a former plan member, an ex-spouse, or a surviving spouse."
Log-Normal Distribution,A log-normal distribution is a statistical distribution of logarithmic values from a related normal distribution. A log-normal distribution can be translated to a normal distribution and vice versa using associated logarithmic calculations.
Logarithmic Price Scale,"A logarithmic price scale is a type of scale used on a chart that is plotted such that two equivalent price changes are represented by the same vertical distance on the scale. The distance between the numbers on the scale decreases as the price of the asset increases. After all, a $1.00 increase in price becomes less influential as the price moves higher since it corresponds to less of a percentage change."
Logistics,"Logistics refers to the overall process of managing how resources are acquired, stored, and transported to their final destination. Logistics management involves identifying prospective distributors and suppliers and determining their effectiveness and accessibility. Logistics managers are referred to as logisticians."
London Interbank Bid Rate (LIBID),"The London Interbank Bid Rate (LIBID) is the average interest rate at which major London banks bid for eurocurrency deposits from other banks in the interbank market. It is the bid rate that banks are willing to pay for eurocurrency deposits and other banks' unsecured funds in the London interbank market, while the more popular LIBOR is the offered rate."
London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR),The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a benchmark interest rate at which major global banks lend to one another in the international interbank market for short-term loans.
London Metal Exchange (LME),"The London Metal Exchange (LME) is a commodities exchange that deals in metals futures and options. The LME is a non-ferrous exchange, which means that iron and steel do not trade there. Instead, tradable contracts include aluminum, copper, gold, silver, cobalt, and zinc."
London Stock Exchange (LSE),"The London Stock Exchange (LSE) is the primary stock exchange in the United Kingdom and the largest in Europe. Originated more than 300 years ago, the regional exchanges were merged in 1973 to form the Stock Exchange of Great Britain and Ireland, later renamed the London Stock Exchange (LSE). The Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100 Share Index, or ""Footsie"", is the dominant index, containing 100 of the top blue-chip stocks on the LSE."
Long Jelly Roll,A long jelly roll is an option strategy that aims to profit from a form of arbitrage based on option pricing. The jelly roll looks for a difference between the pricing of a horizontal spread (also called a calendar spread) composed of call options at a given strike price and the same horizontal spread with the same strike price composed of put options.
Long Position (Long),The term long position describes what an investor has purchased when they buy a security or derivative with the expectation that it will rise in value.
Long Put,"A long put refers to buying a put option, typically in anticipation of a decline in the underlying asset. The term ""long"" here has nothing to do with the length of time before expiration, but rather refers to the trader's action of having bought the option with the hope of selling it at a higher price at a later point in time. A trader could buy a put for speculative reasons, betting that the underlying asset will fall which increases the value of the long put option. A long put could also be used to hedge a long position in the underlying asset. If the underlying asset falls, the put option increases in value helping to offset the loss in the underlying."
Long Run,"The long run is a period of time in which all factors of production and costs are variable. In the long run, firms are able to adjust all costs, whereas in the short run firms are only able to influence prices through adjustments made to production levels. Additionally, while a firm may be a monopoly in the short term, they may expect competition in the long run."
Long Straddle,A long straddle is an options strategy where the trader purchases both a long call and a long put on the same underlying asset with the same expiration date and strike price.
Long Synthetic (Synthetic Put),"A synthetic put is an options strategy that combines a short stock position with a long call option on that same stock to mimic a long put option. It is also called a synthetic long put. Essentially, an investor who has a short position in a stock purchases an at-the-money call option on that same stock. This action is taken to protect against appreciation in the stock's price. A synthetic put is also known as a married call or protective call."
Long Tail,"The long tail is a business strategy that allows companies to realize significant profits by selling low volumes of hard-to-find items to many customers, instead of only selling large volumes of a reduced number of popular items. The term was first coined in 2004 by Chris Anderson, who argued that products in low demand or with low sales volume can collectively make up market share that rivals or exceeds the relatively few current bestsellers and blockbusters but only if the store or distribution channel is large enough."
Long Term,"Long term refers to the extended period of time that an asset is held. Depending on the type of security, a long-term asset can be held for as little as one year or for as long as 30 years or more. Generally speaking, long-term investing for individuals is often thought to be in the range of at least seven to ten years of holding time, although there is no absolute rule."
Long-Legged Doji,"The long-legged doji is a candlestick that consists of long upper and lower shadows and has approximately the same opening and closing price, resulting in a small real body."
Long-Run Average Total Cost (LRATC),"Long-run average total cost (LRATC) is a business metric that represents the average cost per unit of output over the long run, where all inputs are considered to be variable and the scale of production is changeable. The long-run average cost curve shows the lowest total cost to produce a given level of output in the long run."
Long/Short Equity,"Long-short equity is an investing strategy that takes long positions in stocks that are expected to appreciate and short positions in stocks that are expected to decline. A long-short equity strategy seeks to minimize market exposure while profiting from stock gains in the long positions, along with price declines in the short positions. Although this may not always be the case, the strategy should be profitable on a net basis."
Long/Short Fund,"A long/short fund is a type of mutual fund or hedge fund that takes both long and short positions in investments typically from a specific market segment. These funds often use several alternative investing techniques such as leverage, derivatives, and short positions to purchases relatively undervalued securities and sell overvalued ones."
Long-Tail Liability,"A long-tail liability is a type of liability that carries a long settlement period. Long-tail liabilities are likely to result in high incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims, because it may take a long period of time for the claims to be settled."
Long-Term Assets,"Long-term assets are assets, whether tangible or non-tangible, that will benefit the company for more that one year. Also known as non-current assets, long-term assets can include fixed assets such as a company's property, plant, and equipment, but can also include other assets such as long term investments, patents, copyright, franchises, goodwill, trademarks, and trade names, as well as software."
Long-Term Capital Gain or Loss,A long-term capital gain or loss is the gain or loss stemming from the sale of a qualifying investment that has been owned for longer than 12 months at the time of sale. This may be contrasted with short-term gains or losses on investments that are disposed of in less than 12 months time. Long-term capital gains are often given more favorable tax treatment than short-term gains.﻿﻿
Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM),"Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) was a large hedge fund, led by Nobel Prize-winning economists and renowned Wall Street traders, that blew up in 1998, forcing the U.S. government to intervene to prevent financial markets from collapsing."
Long-Term Care (LTC) Insurance,"Long-term care (LTC) insurance is coverage that provides nursing-home care, home-health care, and personal or adult daycare for individuals age 65 or older or with a chronic or disabling condition that needs constant supervision. LTC insurance offers more flexibility and options than many public assistance programs, such as Medicaid."
Long-Term Debt,"Long-term debt is debt that matures in more than one year. Long-term debt can be viewed from two perspectives: financial statement reporting by the issuer and financial investing. In financial statement reporting, companies must record long-term debt issuance and all of its associated payment obligations on its financial statements. On the flip side, investing in long-term debt includes putting money into debt investments with maturities of more than one year."
Long-Term Debt to Capitalization Ratio,"The long-term debt to capitalization ratio, a variation of the traditional debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio, shows the financial leverage of a firm. It is calculated by dividing long-term debt by total available capital (long-term debt, preferred stock, and common stock). Investors compare the financial leverage of firms to analyze the associated investment risk. High ratios indicate riskier investments, as debt is the primary source of financing and introduces a greater risk of insolvency."
Long-Term Debt to Total Assets Ratio,"The long-term debt-to-total-assets ratio is a measurement representing the percentage of a corporation's assets financed with long-term debt, which encompasses loans or other debt obligations lasting more than one year. This ratio provides a general measure of the long-term financial position of a company, including its ability to meet its financial obligations for outstanding loans."
Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities (LEAPS),"Long-term equity anticipation securities (LEAPS) are publicly traded options contracts with expiration dates that are longer than one year, and typically up to three years from issue. They are functionally identical to most other listed options, except with longer times until expiration. They were first introduced by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) in 1990, and are now ubiquitous."
Long-Term Growth (LTG),"Long-term growth (LTG) is an investment strategy that aims to increase the value of a portfolio over a multi-year time frame. Although long-term is relative to an investors’ time horizons and individual style, generally long-term growth is meant to create above market returns over a period of ten years or more. Because of the longer time frame, long-term growth portfolios can be more aggressive in holding a larger percentage of stocks versus fixed-income products like bonds. Whereas an intermediate term balanced fund might have 60% stocks to 40%, a long-term growth fund might have 80% stocks and 20% bonds."
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP),A long-term incentive plan (LTIP) is a company policy that rewards employees for reaching specific goals that lead to increased shareholder value.
Long-Term Investments,"A long-term investment is an account on the asset side of a company's balance sheet that represents the company's investments, including stocks, bonds, real estate, and cash. Long-term investments are assets that a company intends to hold for more than a year."
Long-Term Liabilities,Long-term liabilities are financial obligations of a company that are due more than one year in the future. The current portion of long-term debt is listed separately to provide a more accurate view of a company's current liquidity and the company’s ability to pay current liabilities as they become due. Long-term liabilities are also called long-term debt or noncurrent liabilities.
Longitudinal Data,"Longitudinal data, sometimes called panel data, is a data that is collected through a series of repeated observations of the same subjects over some extended time frame – and is useful for measuring change. Longitudinal data effectively follows the same sample over time, which differs fundamentally from cross-sectional data because it follows the same subjects over some time, while cross-sectional data samples different subjects (whether individuals, firms, countries, or regions) at each point in time. Meanwhile, a cross-sectional data set will always draw a new random sample."
Look-Alike Contracts,"Look-alike contracts are a cash-settled financial product based on the settlement price of a similar exchange-traded, physically settled futures contract. Look-alike contracts are traded over the counter and they carry no risk of actual physical delivery regardless of the terms of the underlying futures contract."
Loophole,"A loophole is a technicality that allows a person or business to avoid the scope of a law or restriction without directly violating the law. Used often in discussions of taxes and their avoidance, loopholes provide ways for individuals and companies to remove income or assets from taxable situations into ones with lower taxes or none at all."
Lorenz Curve,"A Lorenz curve is a graphical representation of income inequality or wealth inequality developed by American economist Max Lorenz in 1905. The graph plots percentiles of the population on the horizontal axis according to income or wealth. It plots cumulative income or wealth on the vertical axis, so that an x-value of 45 and a y-value of 14.2 would mean that the bottom 45% of the population controls 14.2% of the total income or wealth. In practice, a Lorenz curve is usually a mathematical function estimated from an incomplete set of observations of income or wealth."
Loss Adjustment Expense (LAE),A loss adjustment expense (LAE) is an expense associated with investigating and settling an insurance claim.
Loss Carryback,A loss carryback describes a situation in which a business experiences a net operating loss (NOL) and chooses to apply that loss to a prior year's tax return. This results in an immediate refund of taxes previously paid by reducing the tax liability for that previous year.
Loss Carryforward,"A loss carryforward refers to an accounting technique that applies the current year's net operating loss (NOL) to future years' net income to reduce tax liability. For example, if a company experiences negative net operating income (NOI) in year one, but positive NOI in subsequent years, it can reduce future profits using the NOL carryforward to record some or all of the loss from the first year in the subsequent years. This results in lower taxable income in positive NOI years, reducing the amount the company owes the government in taxes. Loss carryforward can also refer to a capital loss carryforward."
Loss Development,"Loss development is the difference between the final losses recorded by an insurer and what the insurer originally recorded. Loss development seeks to account for the fact that some insurance claims take a long time to settle, and that estimates of the total loss an insurer will experience will adjust as claims are finalized."
Loss Given Default (LGD),"Loss given default (LGD) is the amount of money a bank or other financial institution loses when a borrower defaults on a loan, depicted as a percentage of total exposure at the time of default. A financial institution’s total LGD is calculated after a review of all outstanding loans using cumulative losses and exposure."
Loss Leader Strategy,A loss leader strategy involves selling a product or service at a price that is not profitable but is sold to attract new customers or to sell additional products and services to those customers. Loss leading is a common practice when a business first enters a market. A loss leader introduces new customers to a service or product in the hopes of building a customer base and securing future recurring revenue.
Loss Payee,"The loss payee is the party to whom the claim from a loss is to be paid. A loss payee can mean several different things; in the insurance industry, the insured, or the party entitled to payment is the loss payee. The insured can expect reimbursement from the insurance carrier in the event of a loss. One example would be if a borrower defaulted on their loan and didn't pay it."
Loss Ratio,"Loss ratio is used in the insurance industry, representing the ratio of losses to premiums earned. Losses in loss ratios include paid insurance claims and adjustment expenses. The loss ratio formula is insurance claims paid plus adjustment expenses divided by total earned premiums. For example, if a company pays $80 in claims for every $160 in collected premiums, the loss ratio would be 50%."
Loss Reserve,"A loss reserve is an estimate of an insurer’s liability from future claims it will have to pay out on. Typically composed of liquid assets, loss reserves allow an insurer to cover claims made against insurance policies that it underwrites. Estimating liabilities can be a complex undertaking. Insurers must take into account the duration of the insurance contract, the type of insurance offered, the odds of a claim being made, and the time of it being resolved quickly. Insurers have to adjust their loss reserve calculations as circumstances change."
Lost Decade,"The Lost Decade is commonly used to describe the decade of the 1990s in Japan, a period of economic stagnation which became one of the longest-running economic crises in recorded history. Later decades are also included in some definitions, with the period from 1991-2011 (or even 1991-2021) sometimes also referred to as Japan's Lost Decades."
Lost Policy Release (LPR),A lost policy release (LPR) is a statement releasing an insurance company from its liabilities. An LPR is signed by the insured party and signifies that the policy in question has been lost or destroyed or is being retained.
Lot (Securities Trading),"A lot in the financial markets is the number of units of a financial instrument bought on an exchange. The number of units is determined by the lot size. For example, in the stock market, a round lot is 100 shares. However, investors do not have to buy round lots, where a lot can be any number of shares."
Love Money,"Love money refers to seed capital that has been extended by family or friends to an entrepreneur to start a business venture. The decision to lend money and the terms of the agreement are usually based on the relationship between the two parties, instead of a formulaic risk analysis."
Low Exercise Price Option (LEPO),"A low exercise price option (LEPO) is a European-style call option with an exercise price of one cent. Both buyer and seller operate on margin. Because it is almost a certainty that the holder will exercise the option at maturity, it is somewhat similar to a futures contract."
Low-Hanging Fruit,"The term ""low-hanging fruit"" is a commonly-used metaphor for doing the simplest or easiest work first requiring little or no effort, or for a quick fix that produces ripe, delectable results. In investing, low-hanging fruit may refer to those obviously underpriced securities or ""no-brainer"" investments that would be snatched up first without much effort involved in terms of research or due diligence."
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit,"The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) is a tax incentive for housing developers to construct, purchase, or renovate housing for low-income individuals and families. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit was written into the Tax Reform Act of 1986.﻿﻿"
Low Interest Rate Environment,"A low interest rate environment occurs when the risk-free rate of interest, typically set by a central bank, is lower than the historic average for a prolonged period of time. In the United States, the risk-free rate is generally defined by the interest rate on Treasury securities."
Low/No Documentation Loan,"A low/no documentation loan allows a potential borrower to apply for a mortgage while providing little or no information regarding their employment, income, or assets. Regulation of these loans has evolved significantly since 2008, but they remain an option for some borrowers in nontraditional financial situations."
Low Volume Pullback,"A low volume pullback is a technical correction toward an area of support that occurs on lower-than-average volume. Since the move occurs on low volume, traders often attribute the pullback to weak longs locking in profits rather than a reversal."
Lower of Cost or Market Method,"The lower of cost or market (LCM) method states that when valuing a company's inventory, it is recorded on the balance sheet at either the historical cost or the market value. Historical cost refers to the cost at which the inventory was purchased."
Loyalty Program,"Loyalty programs, sponsored by retailers and other businesses, offer rewards, discounts, and other special incentives as a way to attract and retain customers. They are designed to encourage repeat business, offering people a reward for store/brand loyalty (hence the name). Typically, the more often a customer patronizes the merchant—and the more they spend—the greater their rewards."
Ltd. (Limited),"Ltd. is a standard abbreviation for ""limited,"" a form of corporate structure available in countries including the U.K., Ireland, and Canada. The term appears as a suffix that follows the company name, indicating that it is a private limited company. In a limited company, shareholders' liability is limited to the capital they originally invested. If such a company becomes insolvent, the shareholders' personal assets remain protected."
Lucrative,"Lucrative means profitable, and it can be used to describe any venture or activity that has the potential to make money. Thus, an investment or commercial venture is considered to be lucrative if it produces substantial wealth. A lucrative activity could be anything from collecting art, designing an invention, or following through on an idea for an innovative product or service."
Luhn Algorithm,"The Luhn Algorithm—also known as the “Modulus 10 Algorithm”—is a formula that is used to determine whether the identification number provided by a user is accurate. The formula is widely used in validating credit card numbers, as well as other number sequences such as government Social Security Numbers (SSNs)."
Lump-Sum Payment,"A lump-sum payment is an often large sum that is paid in one single payment instead of broken up into installments. It is also known as a bullet repayment when dealing with a loan. They are sometimes associated with pension plans and other retirement vehicles, such as 401k accounts, where retirees accept a smaller upfront lump-sum payment rather than a larger sum paid out over time. These are often paid out in the event of debentures."
Luxury Item,"A luxury item is not necessary to live, but it is deemed highly desirable within a culture or society. Demand for luxury goods increases when a person's wealth or income increases. Typically, the greater the percentage increase in income, the greater the percentage increase in luxury item purchases."
Luxury Tax,A luxury tax is a sales tax or surcharge levied only on certain products or services that are deemed non-essential or accessible only to the super-wealthy.
M1,"M1 is the money supply that is composed of physical currency and coin, demand deposits, travelers' checks, other checkable deposits, and negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts. M1 includes the most liquid portions of the money supply because it contains currency and assets that either are or can be quickly converted to cash. However, ""near money"" and ""near, near money,"" which fall under M2 and M3, cannot be converted to currency as quickly."
M2,"M2 is a calculation of the money supply that includes all elements of M1 as well as ""near money."" M1 includes cash and checking deposits, while near money refers to savings deposits, money market securities, mutual funds, and other time deposits. These assets are less liquid than M1 and not as suitable as exchange mediums, but they can be quickly converted into cash or checking deposits."
M3,"M3 is a measure of the money supply that includes M2 as well as large time deposits, institutional money market funds, short-term repurchase agreements (repo), and larger liquid assets."
M-Pesa,"M-Pesa is a mobile banking service that allows users to store and transfer money through their mobile phones. M-Pesa was introduced in Kenya as an alternative way for the population of the country to have access to financial services. Safaricom, the largest mobile phone operator in Kenya, launched M-Pesa in 2007. The service is a blend of two entities where M means mobile and Pesa means money or payment in the Swahili language."
Maastricht Treaty,"The Maastricht Treaty, known formally as the Treaty on European Union, is the international agreement responsible for the creation of the European Union (EU) signed in 1991 and which became effective in 1993. The European Union (EU) is a group of 28 countries that operates as a cohesive economic and political block. Nineteen of the countries use the euro as their official currency."
Macaulay Duration,The Macaulay duration is the weighted average term to maturity of the cash flows from a bond. The weight of each cash flow is determined by dividing the present value of the cash flow by the price. Macaulay duration is frequently used by portfolio managers who use an immunization strategy.
Macro Environment,"A macro environment is the condition that exists in the economy as a whole, rather than in a particular sector or region. In general, the macro environment includes trends in the gross domestic product (GDP), inflation, employment, spending, and monetary and fiscal policy. The macro-environment is closely linked to the general business cycle as opposed to the performance of an individual business sector."
Macro Manager,"A macro manager is a type of boss or supervisor who takes a more hands-off approach and lets employees do their jobs with minimal direct supervision. This style of leadership is referred to as macromanagement. Macro managers can be thought of by some employees as supervisors who do not give them enough support or feedback to do their jobs effectively, while others may be glad to be trusted and left alone."
Macroeconomic Factor,"A macroeconomic factor is an influential fiscal, natural, or geopolitical event that broadly affects a regional or national economy. Macroeconomic factors tend to impact wide swaths of populations, rather than just a few select individuals. Examples of macroeconomic factors include economic outputs, unemployment rates, and inflation. These indicators of economic performance are closely monitored by governments, businesses and consumers alike."
Magic Formula Investing,"Magic formula investing refers to a rules-based, disciplined investing strategy that teaches people a relatively simple and easy-to-understand method for value investing. It relies on quantitative screens of companies and stocks, and is designed to beat the stock market's average annual returns using the S&P 500 to represent the market return. Put simply, it works by ranking stocks based on their price and returns on capital."
Magna Cum Laude,"Magna cum laude is an academic honorific used by educational institutions to signify that an academic degree was earned with notable distinction. The Latin phrase means ""with great praise."""
What Is the Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) Line on a Check?,"Magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) is a technology used primarily to identify and process checks. The MICR on a check is the string of characters that appears at the bottom left of the check. It consists of three groups of numbers, including the bank routing number, the account number, and the check number."
Main Street,"Main Street is a colloquial term used by economists to refer collectively to America's independent small businesses. It gets its name from a common name for the principal commercial street of small towns across the country. In England, the equivalent term is High Street."
Maintenance Expenses,"The term maintenance expense refers to any cost incurred by an individual or business to keep their assets in good working condition. These costs may be spent for the general maintenance of items like running anti-virus software on computer systems or they may be used for repairs such as fixing a car or machinery. These expenses are in addition to the actual purchase price of an asset, so individuals and companies should be able and willing to foot the bill in order to keep their assets in running order."
Majority Shareholder,"A majority shareholder is a person or entity that owns and controls more than 50% of a company's outstanding shares. As a majority shareholder, a person or operating entity has a significant amount of influence over the company, especially if their shares are voting shares. Voting shares give a shareholder permission to vote on different corporate decisions, such as who should be on the company’s board of directors."
Make-or-Buy Decision,A make-or-buy decision is an act of choosing between manufacturing a product in-house or purchasing it from an external supplier.
Make to Order (MTO),"Make to order (MTO), or made to order, is a business production strategy that typically allows consumers to purchase products that are customized to their specifications. It is a manufacturing process in which the production of an item begins only after a confirmed customer order is received. It is also known as mass customization."
Make to Stock (MTS),"Make to stock (MTS) is a traditional production strategy that is used by businesses to match the inventory with anticipated consumer demand. Instead of setting a production level and then attempting to sell goods, a company using MTS would estimate how many orders its products could generate, and then supply enough stock to meet those orders."
Make Whole Call Provision,A make-whole call provision is a type of call provision on a bond allowing the issuer to pay off remaining debt early. The issuer typically has to make a lump-sum payment to the investor. The payment is derived from a formula based on the net present value (NPV) of previously scheduled coupon payments and the principal that the investor would have received.
Malpractice Insurance,Malpractice insurance is a type of professional liability insurance purchased by healthcare professionals. This insurance coverage protects healthcare providers against patients who file suits against them under the complaint that they were harmed by the professional's negligence or intentionally harmful treatment decisions. Malpractice insurance also covers the death of a patient.
Managed Account,A managed account is an investment account that is owned by an investor but managed by somebody else. The account owner can either be an institutional investor or an individual retail investor. A professional money manager hired by the investor then oversees the account and the trading activity within it.
Managed Futures,Managed futures refers to an investment where a portfolio of futures contracts is actively managed by professionals. Managed futures are considered an alternative investment and are often used by funds and institutional investors to provide both portfolio and market diversification.
Management Buyout (MBO),A management buyout (MBO) is a transaction where a company’s management team purchases the assets and operations of the business they manage. A management buyout is appealing to professional managers because of the greater potential rewards and control from being owners of the business rather than employees.
Management by Objectives (MBO),"Management by objectives (MBO) is a strategic management model that aims to improve the performance of an organization by clearly defining objectives that are agreed to by both management and employees. According to the theory, having a say in goal setting and action plans encourages participation and commitment among employees, as well as aligning objectives across the organization."
Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A),"Management discussion and analysis (MD&A) is a section of a public company's annual report or quarterly filing. The MD&A addresses the company’s performance. In this section, the company’s management and executives, also known as the C-suite, present an analysis of the company’s performance with qualitative and quantitative measures."
Management Fee,A management fee is a charge levied by an investment manager for managing an investment fund. The management fee is intended to compensate the managers for their time and expertise for selecting stocks and managing the portfolio. It can also include other items such as investor relations (IR) expenses and the administration costs of the fund.
Managerial Accounting,"Managerial accounting is the practice of identifying, measuring, analyzing, interpreting, and communicating financial information to managers for the pursuit of an organization's goals. It varies from financial accounting because the intended purpose of managerial accounting is to assist users internal to the company in making well-informed business decisions."
Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP),"The manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) is the price that a product's manufacturer recommends it be sold for at point of sale. The MSRP is also referred to as the list price by some retailers. Every retail product can have an MSRP, though they are frequently used with automobiles. Other higher-priced goods, such as appliances and electronics, also have an MSRP as well."
Manufacturing,"Manufacturing is the processing of raw materials or parts into finished goods through the use of tools, human labor, machinery, and chemical processing. Large-scale manufacturing allows for the mass production of goods using assembly line processes and advanced technologies as core assets. Efficient manufacturing techniques enable manufacturers to take advantage of economies of scale, producing more units at a lower cost."
Manufacturing Resource Planning,"Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II) is an integrated information system used by businesses. Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II) evolved from early Materials Requirement Planning (MRP) systems by including the integration of additional data, such as employee and financial needs."
Maquiladora,The term maquiladora refers to a factory or manufacturing plant in Mexico. These corporations are approved for operation by the country's Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Development under a decree established in 1989 and are owned by foreign entities.
Margin Account,"A margin account is a brokerage account in which the broker lends the customer cash to purchase stocks or other financial products. The loan in the account is collateralized by the securities purchased and cash, and comes with a periodic interest rate. Because the customer is investing with borrowed money, the customer is using leverage which will magnify profits and losses for the customer."
Margin Debt,"Margin debt is debt a brokerage customer takes on by trading on margin. When purchasing securities through a broker, investors have the option of using a cash account and covering the entire cost of the investment themselves, or using a margin account—meaning they borrow part of the initial capital from their broker. The portion the investors borrow is known as margin debt, while the portion they fund themselves is the margin, or equity."
Margin Loan Availability,Margin loan availability describes the amount in a margin account that is currently available for purchasing securities on margin or the amount that is available for withdrawal. A margin account makes loans available to the customer of a brokerage firm using the customer's securities in their account as collateral.
Margin of Safety,"Margin of safety is a principle of investing in which an investor only purchases securities when their market price is significantly below their intrinsic value. In other words, when the market price of a security is significantly below your estimation of its intrinsic value, the difference is the margin of safety. Because investors may set a margin of safety in accordance with their own risk preferences, buying securities when this difference is present allows an investment to be made with minimal downside risk."
Marginal Analysis,"Marginal analysis is an examination of the additional benefits of an activity compared to the additional costs incurred by that same activity. Companies use marginal analysis as a decision-making tool to help them maximize their potential profits. Marginal refers to the focus on the cost or benefit of the next unit or individual, for example, the cost to produce one more widget or the profit earned by adding one more worker."
Marginal Benefits,A marginal benefit is a maximum amount a consumer is willing to pay for an additional good or service. It is also the additional satisfaction or utility that a consumer receives when the additional good or service is purchased. The marginal benefit for a consumer tends to decrease as consumption of the good or service increases.
Marginal Cost of Production,"In economics, the marginal cost of production is the change in total production cost that comes from making or producing one additional unit. To calculate marginal cost, divide the change in production costs by the change in quantity. The purpose of analyzing marginal cost is to determine at what point an organization can achieve economies of scale to optimize production and overall operations. If the marginal cost of producing one additional unit is lower than the per-unit price, the producer has the potential to gain a profit."
Marginal Profit,Marginal profit is the profit earned by a firm or individual when one additional or marginal unit is produced and sold. Marginal refers to the added cost or profit earned with producing the next unit. Marginal product is the additional revenue earned while the marginal cost is the added cost for producing one additional unit.
Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC),"In economics, the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is defined as the proportion of an aggregate raise in pay that a consumer spends on the consumption of goods and services, as opposed to saving it. Marginal propensity to consume is a component of Keynesian macroeconomic theory and is calculated as the change in consumption divided by the change in income. MPC is depicted by a consumption line, which is a sloped line created by plotting the change in consumption on the vertical ""y"" axis and the change in income on the horizontal ""x"" axis."
Marginal Propensity to Import (MPM),The marginal propensity to import (MPM) is the amount imports increase or decrease with each unit rise or decline in disposable income. The idea is that rising income for businesses and households spurs greater demand for goods from abroad and vice versa.
Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS),"In Keynesian economic theory, the marginal propensity to save (MPS) refers to the proportion of an aggregate raise in income that a consumer saves rather than spends on the consumption of goods and services. Put differently, the marginal propensity to save is the proportion of each added dollar of income that is saved rather than spent. MPS is a component of Keynesian macroeconomic theory and is calculated as the change in savings divided by the change in income, or as the complement of the marginal propensity to consume (MPC)."
Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS),"In economics, the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) is the amount of a good that a consumer is willing to consume in relation to another good, as long as the new good is equally satisfying. MRS is used in indifference theory to analyze consumer behavior."
Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution,The marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS) is an economic theory that illustrates the rate at which one factor must decrease so that the same level of productivity can be maintained when another factor is increased.
Marginal Rate of Transformation,The marginal rate of transformation (MRT) is the number of units or amount of a good that must be forgone to create or attain one unit of another good. It is the number of units of good Y that will be foregone to produce an extra unit of good X while keeping the factors of production and technology constant.
Marginal Revenue (MR),"Marginal revenue (MR) is the increase in revenue that results from the sale of one additional unit of output. While marginal revenue can remain constant over a certain level of output, it follows from the law of diminishing returns and will eventually slow down as the output level increases. In economic theory, perfectly competitive firms continue producing output until marginal revenue equals marginal cost."
Marginal Revenue Product (MRP),"Marginal revenue product (MRP), also known as the marginal value product, is the marginal revenue created due to an addition of one unit of resource. The marginal revenue product is calculated by multiplying the marginal physical product (MPP) of the resource by the marginal revenue (MR) generated. The MRP assumes that the expenditures on other factors remain unchanged and helps determine the optimal level of a resource."
Marginal Social Cost (MSC),Marginal social cost (MSC) is the total cost society pays for the production of another unit or for taking further action in the economy. The total cost of the production of an additional unit of something is not merely the direct cost undertaken by the producer but also includes costs to other stakeholders and the environment as a whole. MSC is calculated as:
Marginal Tax Rate,"The marginal tax rate is the tax rate you pay on an additional dollar of income. In the United States, the federal marginal tax rate for individuals increases as income rises. This method of taxation, known as progressive taxation, aims to tax individuals based upon their earnings, with low-income earners being taxed at a lower rate than higher-income earners."
Marginal Utility,Marginal utility is the added satisfaction that a consumer gets from having one more unit of a good or service. The concept of marginal utility is used by economists to determine how much of an item consumers are willing to purchase.
Marital Property,"Marital property is a U.S. state-level legal term that refers to property acquired during the course of a marriage. Property that an individual owns before a marriage is considered separate property, as are inheritances or third-party gifts given to an individual during a marriage. Marriage partners may choose to exclude certain property from marital property by signing a prenuptial or a postnuptial agreement."
Maritime Law,"Maritime law, also known as admiralty law, is a body of laws, conventions, and treaties that govern private maritime business and other nautical matters, such as shipping or offenses occurring on open water. International rules, governing the use of the oceans and seas, are known as the Law of the Sea."
Mark Zuckerberg,"Mark Zuckerberg is a self-taught computer programmer and co-founder, chair, and chief executive officer of Facebook (FB), which he founded in his Harvard University dorm room in 2004 along with Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes, and Eduardo Saverin."
Market,"A market is a place where two parties can gather to facilitate the exchange of goods and services. The parties involved are usually buyers and sellers. The market may be physical like a retail outlet, where people meet face-to-face, or virtual like an online market, where there is no direct physical contact between buyers and sellers."
Market Approach,"The market approach is a method of determining the value of an asset based on the selling price of similar assets. It is one of three popular valuation methods, along with the cost approach and discounted cash-flow analysis (DCF)."
Market Basket,A market basket is a selected group of products or assets designed to track the general performance of a specific market segment. This is sometimes known as a basket of goods.
Market Breadth,"Market breadth indicators analyze the number of stocks advancing relative to those that are declining in a given index or on a stock exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or Nasdaq. Positive market breadth occurs when more stocks are advancing than are declining. This suggests that the bulls are in control of the market's momentum and helps confirm a price rise in the index. Conversely, a disproportional number of declining securities is used to confirm bearish momentum and a downside move in the stock index."
Market Cannibalization,Market cannibalization is a loss in sales caused by a company's introduction of a new product that displaces one of its own older products. The cannibalization of existing products leads to no increase in the company's market share despite sales growth for the new product.
Market Capitalization,"Market capitalization refers to the total dollar market value of a company's outstanding shares of stock. Commonly referred to as ""market cap,"" it is calculated by multiplying the total number of a company's outstanding shares by the current market price of one share."
Market Capitalization-to-GDP Ratio,"The stock market capitalization-to-GDP ratio is a ratio used to determine whether an overall market is undervalued or overvalued compared to a historical average. The ratio can be used to focus on specific markets, such as the U.S. market, or it can be applied to the global market, depending on what values are used in the calculation. It is calculated by dividing the stock market cap by gross domestic product (GDP). The stock market capitalization-to-GDP ratio is also known as the Buffett Indicator—after investor Warren Buffett, who popularized its use."
Market Cycles,"Market cycles, also known as stock market cycles, is a wide term referring to trends or patterns that emerge during different markets or business environments. During a cycle, some securities or asset classes outperform others because their business models aligned with conditions for growth. Market cycles are the period between the two latest highs or lows of a common benchmark, such as the S&P 500, highlighting a fund’s performance through both an up and a down market."
Market Depth,"Market depth refers to a market's ability to absorb relatively large market orders without significantly impacting the price of the security.

Minsky Moment is named after economist Hyman Minsky and defines the point in time where the sudden decline in market sentiment inevitably leads to a market crash.
Misery Index,"The misery index is meant to measure the degree of economic distress felt by everyday people, due to the risk of (or actual) joblessness combined with an increasing cost of living. The misery index is calculated by adding the unemployment rate to the inflation rate."
Misrepresentation,"A misrepresentation is a false statement of a material fact made by one party which affects the other party's decision in agreeing to a contract. If the misrepresentation is discovered, the contract can be declared void and, depending on the situation, the adversely impacted party may seek damages. In this type of contract dispute, the party that is accused of making the misrepresentation is the defendant, and the party making the claim is the plaintiff."
Mission Statement,"A mission statement is used by a company to explain, in simple and concise terms, its purpose(s) for being. The statement is generally short, either a single sentence or a short paragraph."
Mixed Economic System,"A mixed economic system is a system that combines aspects of both capitalism and socialism. A mixed economic system protects private property and allows a level of economic freedom in the use of capital, but also allows for governments to interfere in economic activities in order to achieve social aims. According to neoclassical theory, mixed economies are less efficient than pure free markets, but proponents of government interventions argue that the base conditions required for efficiency in free markets, such as equal information and rational market participants, cannot be achieved in practical application."
Mobile Banking,"Mobile banking is the act of making financial transactions on a mobile device (cell phone, tablet, etc.). This activity can be as simple as a bank sending fraud or usage activity to a client’s cell phone or as complex as a client paying bills or sending money abroad. Advantages to mobile banking include the ability to bank anywhere and at any time. Disadvantages include security concerns and a limited range of capabilities when compared to banking in person or on a computer."
Mobile Commerce,"Mobile commerce, also known as m-commerce or mcommerce, is the use of wireless handheld devices like cellphones and tablets to conduct commercial transactions online, including the purchase and sale of products, online banking, and paying bills.

Model Risk,"Model risk is a type of risk that occurs when a financial model is used to measure quantitative information such as a firm's market risks or value transactions, and the model fails or performs inadequately and leads to adverse outcomes for the firm."
Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT),"Modern portfolio theory (MPT) is a theory on how risk-averse investors can construct portfolios to maximize expected return based on a given level of market risk. Harry Markowitz pioneered this theory in his paper ""Portfolio Selection,"" which was published in the Journal of Finance in 1952.﻿﻿ He was later awarded a Nobel Prize for his work on modern portfolio theory.﻿﻿"
Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS),The modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS) is a depreciation system used for tax purposes in the U.S. MACRS depreciation allows the capitalized cost of an asset to be recovered over a specified period via annual deductions. The MACRS system puts fixed assets into classes that have set depreciation periods.
Modified Accrual Accounting,"Modified accrual accounting is an alternative bookkeeping method that combines accrual-basis accounting with cash-basis accounting. It recognizes revenues when they become available and measurable and, with a few exceptions, records expenditures when liabilities are incurred. Modified accrual accounting is commonly used by government agencies."
Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI),"Modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is an important number. First of all, it determines whether you can contribute to a Roth IRA and if you can deduct IRA contributions. It also factors into your eligibility for certain education tax benefits and income tax credits. Furthermore, it establishes your eligibility for income-based Medicaid and subsidized health insurance plans on the Health Insurance Marketplace."
Modified Cash Basis,"Modified cash basis is an accounting method that combines elements of the two major bookkeeping practices: cash and accrual accounting. It seeks to get the best of both worlds, recording sales and expenses for long-term assets on an accrual basis and those of short-term assets on a cash basis. The goal here is to provide a clearer financial picture without dealing with the costs of switching to full-blown accrual accounting."
Modified Endowment Contract,A modified endowment contract (MEC) is a tax qualification of a life insurance policy whose cumulative premiums exceed federal tax law limits. The taxation structure and IRS policy classification changes after a life insurance policy has morphed into a modified endowment contract.
Modified Dietz Method,The modified Dietz method is a way to measure a portfolio's historical return that is based on a weighted calculation of its cash flow. The method takes into account the timing of cash flows and assumes that there is a constant rate of return over a specified period of time.
Modified Gross Lease,"A modified gross lease is a type of real estate rental agreement where the tenant pays base rent at the lease's inception, but it takes on a proportional share of some of the other costs associated with the property as well, such as property taxes, utilities, insurance, and maintenance."
Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR),"The modified internal rate of return (MIRR) assumes that positive cash flows are reinvested at the firm's cost of capital and that the initial outlays are financed at the firm's financing cost. By contrast, the traditional internal rate of return (IRR) assumes the cash flows from a project are reinvested at the IRR itself. The MIRR, therefore, more accurately reflects the cost and profitability of a project."
Modigliani-Miller Theorem (M&M),"The Modigliani-Miller theorem (M&M) states that the market value of a company is correctly calculated as the present value of its future earnings and its underlying assets, and is independent of its capital structure."
Modus Operandi,"Modus operandi is a Latin term used in English-speaking circles to describe an individual's or group's habitual way of operating, which forms a discernible pattern. The term is primarily used when discussing criminal behavior, but it is not exclusively uttered in this context. Modus operandi can also be defined as a specific method of operation."
Mom-and-Pop,"Mom-and-pop is a colloquial term used to describe a small, family-owned, or independent business. Mom-and-pop stores are often operations that struggle to compete with more substantial establishments, such as big-box retailers, who generally boast more buying power than smaller players. In the last few years, ""shop local"" and ""shop small"" have been used as slogans in marketing campaigns. The term ""mom-and-pop"" also refers to inexperienced investors who casually play the market."
Momentum,"Momentum is the rate of acceleration of a security's price—that is, the speed at which the price is changing. Momentum trading is a strategy that seeks to capitalize on momentum to enter a trend as it is picking up steam."
Momentum Investing,Momentum investing is a strategy that aims to capitalize on the continuance of an existing market trend.
Monetarist,"A monetarist is an economist who holds the strong belief that money supply—including physical currency, deposits, and credit—is the primary factor affecting demand in an economy. Consequently, the economy's performance—its growth or contraction—can be regulated by changes in the money supply."
Monetarist Theory,"The monetarist theory is an economic concept that contends that changes in money supply are the most significant determinants of the rate of economic growth and the behavior of the business cycle. When monetarist theory works in practice, central banks, which control the levers of monetary policy, can exert much power over economic growth rates."
Monetary Aggregates,"Money aggregates are broad categories that measure the money supply in an economy. In the United States, labels are attributed to standardized monetary aggregates:"
Monetary Base,The monetary base (or M0) is the total amount of a currency that is either in general circulation in the hands of the public or in the form of commercial bank deposits held in the central bank's reserves. This measure of the money supply is not often cited since it excludes other forms of non-currency money that are prevalent in a modern economy.
Monetary Policy,"Monetary policy, the demand side of economic policy, refers to the actions undertaken by a nation's central bank to control money supply and achieve macroeconomic goals that promote sustainable economic growth."
Monetize,"Monetize refers to the process of turning a non-revenue-generating item into cash. In many cases, monetization looks to novel methods of creating income from new sources; for instance, by embedding ad revenues inside of social media video clips to pay content creators. Sometimes, monetization is due to privatization (sometimes called commodification), whereby a previously free or public asset is turned into a profit center—such as a public road being converted into a private tollway."
Money Center Banks,"A money center bank is similar in structure to a standard bank; however, it's borrowing, and lending activities are with governments, large corporations, and regular banks. These types of financial institutions (or designated branches of these institutions) generally do not borrow from or lend to consumers."
Money Factor,"The money factor is a method for determining the financing charges on a lease with monthly payments. The money factor can be translated into the more common annual percentage rate (APR) by multiplying the money factor by 2,400."
Money Flow,"Money flow is calculated by averaging the high, low and closing prices, and multiplying by the daily volume. Comparing that result with the number for the previous day tells traders whether money flow was positive or negative for the current day. Positive money flow indicates that prices are likely to move higher, while negative money flow suggests prices are about to fall. The below example shows negative money flow between Day One and Day Two:"
Money Flow Index (MFI),The Money Flow Index (MFI) is a technical oscillator that uses price and volume data for identifying overbought or oversold signals in an asset. It can also be used to spot divergences which warn of a trend change in price. The oscillator moves between 0 and 100.
Money Illusion,"Money illusion is an economic theory positing that people have a tendency to view their wealth and income in nominal dollar terms, rather than in real terms. In other words, it is assumed that people do not take into account the level of inflation in an economy, wrongly believing that a dollar is worth the same as it was the prior year."
Money Laundering,"Money laundering is the illegal process of making large amounts of money generated by a criminal activity, such as drug trafficking or terrorist funding, appear to have come from a legitimate source. The money from the criminal activity is considered dirty, and the process ""launders"" it to make it look clean."
Money Management,"Money management refers to the processes of budgeting, saving, investing, spending, or otherwise overseeing the capital usage of an individual or group. The term can also refer more narrowly to investment management and portfolio management."
Money Manager,"A money manager is a person or financial firm that manages the securities portfolio of an individual or institutional investor. Typically, a money manager employs people with various expertise ranging from research and selection of investment options to monitoring the assets and deciding when to sell them."
Money Market,"The money market refers to trading in very short-term debt investments. At the wholesale level, it involves large-volume trades between institutions and traders. At the retail level, it includes money market mutual funds bought by individual investors and money market accounts opened by bank customers."
Money Market Fund,"A money market fund is a kind of mutual fund that invests in highly liquid, near-term instruments. These instruments include cash, cash equivalent securities, and high-credit-rating, debt-based securities with a short-term maturity (such as U.S. Treasuries). Money market funds are intended to offer investors high liquidity with a very low level of risk. Money market funds are also called money market mutual funds."
Money Market Yield,"The money market yield is the interest rate earned by investing in securities with high liquidity and maturities of less than one year such as negotiable certificates of deposit, U.S. Treasury bills, and municipal notes. Money market yield is calculated by taking the holding period yield and multiplying it by a 360-day bank year divided by days to maturity. It can also be calculated using a bank discount yield."
Money Order,"A money order is a certificate, usually issued by a government or banking institution, that allows the stated payee to receive cash on demand. A money order functions much like a check, in that the person who purchased the money order may stop payment."
Money Purchase Pension Plan,A money purchase pension plan is an employee retirement benefit plan that resembles a corporate profit-sharing program. It requires the employer to deposit a set percentage of the participating employee's salary in the account every year. The employee is not permitted to contribute to the fund but may choose how to invest the money based on options offered by the employer.
Money Supply,The money supply is all the currency and other liquid instruments in a country's economy on the date measured. The money supply roughly includes both cash and deposits that can be used almost as easily as cash.
Money-Weighted Rate of Return,The money-weighted rate of return (MWRR) is a measure of the performance of an investment. The MWRR is calculated by finding the rate of return that will set the present values (PV) of all cash flows equal to the value of the initial investment. The MWRR is equivalent to the internal rate of return (IRR).
Monopolist,"A monopolist is an individual, group, or company that controls all of the market for a particular good or service. A monopolist probably also believes in policies that favor monopolies since it gives them greater power. A monopolist has little incentive to improve their product because customers have no alternatives. Instead, their motivation is focused on protecting the monopoly."
Monopolistic Competition,"Monopolistic competition characterizes an industry in which many firms offer products or services that are similar, but not perfect substitutes. Barriers to entry and exit in a monopolistic competitive industry are low, and the decisions of any one firm do not directly affect those of its competitors. Monopolistic competition is closely related to the business strategy of brand differentiation"
Monopolistic Markets,"A monopolistic market is a theoretical condition that describes a market where only one company may offer products and services to the public. A monopolistic market is the opposite of a perfectly competitive market, in which an infinite number of firms operate. In a purely monopolistic model, the monopoly firm can restrict output, raise prices, and enjoy super-normal profits in the long run."
Month-To-Month Tenancy,"A month-to-month tenancy is a periodic tenancy created when the renter is granted possession of the property with no definite expiration date and pays the owner on a monthly basis. This tenancy is most commonly found in residential leases. In situations where there is no written agreement, tenancy is also considered to be on a month-to-month basis."
Monthly Active User (MAU),"Monthly active users (MAU) is a key performance indicator (KPI) used by social networking and other companies to count the number of unique users who visit a site within the past month. Websites generally recognize monthly active users via an identification number, email address, or username."
Moore's Law,"Moore's Law refers to Moore's perception that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years, though the cost of computers is halved. Moore's Law states that we can expect the speed and capability of our computers to increase every couple of years, and we will pay less for them. Another tenet of Moore's Law asserts that this growth is exponential."
Moral Hazard,"Moral hazard is the risk that a party has not entered into a contract in good faith or has provided misleading information about its assets, liabilities, or credit capacity. In addition, moral hazard also may mean a party has an incentive to take unusual risks in a desperate attempt to earn a profit before the contract settles. Moral hazards can be present at any time two parties come into agreement with one another. Each party in a contract may have the opportunity to gain from acting contrary to the principles laid out by the agreement."
Moral Suasion,"Moral suasion is the act of persuading a person or group to act in a certain way through rhetorical appeals, persuasion, or implicit and explicit threats—as opposed to the use of outright coercion or physical force. In economics, it is sometimes used in reference to central banks."
Moratorium,"A moratorium is a temporary suspension of an activity or law until future consideration warrants lifting the suspension, such as if and when the issues that led to moratorium have been resolved. A moratorium may be imposed by a government, by regulators, or by a business."
Morbidity Rate,"The term morbidity rate refers to the rate at which a disease occurs in a population. These illnesses can range from acute to chronic, long-lasting conditions. The rate of morbidity can be used to determine the health of a population and its health care needs. Morbidity rates are also used in actuarial professions, such as health insurance, life insurance, and long-term care insurance to figure out the premiums to charge customers. This rate shouldn't be confused with mortality rate, another metric used to highlight the frequency of death in a given population."
Morning Star,A morning star is a visual pattern consisting of three candlesticks that is interpreted as a bullish sign by technical analysts. A morning star forms following a downward trend and it indicates the start of an upward climb. It is a sign of a reversal in the previous price trend. Traders watch for the formation of a morning star and then seek confirmation that a reversal is indeed occurring using additional indicators.

Morningstar Sustainability Rating,"The Morningstar Sustainability Rating is a reliable and objective way for investors to see how approximately 20,000 mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are meeting environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) challenges."
Mortality Table,"A mortality table, also known as a life table or actuarial table, shows the rate of deaths occurring in a defined population during a selected time interval, or survival rates from birth to death. A mortality table typically shows the general probability of a person's death before their next birthday, based on their current age. These tables are typically used in order to inform the construction of insurance policies and other forms of liability management."
Mortgage,"A mortgage is a loan that the borrower uses to purchase or maintain a home or other form of real estate and agrees to pay back over time, typically in a series of regular payments. The property serves as collateral to secure the loan."

A mortgage banker's primary business is to earn the fees associated with loan origination. Most mortgage bankers do not retain the mortgage in a portfolio."
Mortgage Bond,"A mortgage bond is secured by a mortgage, or a pool of mortgages, that are typically backed by real estate holdings and real property, such as equipment."
Mortgage Broker,"A mortgage broker is an intermediary who brings mortgage borrowers and mortgage lenders together, but who does not use their own funds to originate mortgages. A mortgage broker helps borrowers connect with lenders and seeks out the best fit in terms of the borrower's financial situation and interest-rate needs. The mortgage broker also gathers paperwork from the borrower and passes that paperwork along to a mortgage lender for underwriting and approval purposes. The broker earns a commission from either the borrower, the lender, or both at closing."
Mortgage Forbearance Agreement,"A mortgage forbearance agreement is an agreement made between a mortgage lender and a delinquent borrower. In this agreement, a lender agrees not to exercise its legal right to foreclose on a mortgage, and the borrower agrees to a mortgage plan that will—over a certain time period—bring the borrower current on their payments."
Mortgage Insurance,"Mortgage insurance is an insurance policy that protects a mortgage lender or titleholder if the borrower defaults on payments, passes away, or is otherwise unable to meet the contractual obligations of the mortgage.

Mortgage originators are part of the primary mortgage market and must work with underwriters and loan processors from the application date until closing to gather the necessary documentation and guide the file through the approval process.
Mortgage Rate,"A mortgage rate is the rate of interest charged on a mortgage. Mortgage rates are determined by the lender and can be either fixed, staying the same for the term of the mortgage, or variable, fluctuating with a benchmark interest rate. Mortgage rates vary for borrowers based on their credit profile. Mortgage rate averages also rise and fall with interest rate cycles and can drastically affect the homebuyers' market."
Mortgage Rate Lock Float Down,The term mortgage rate lock float down refers to a financing option that locks in the interest rate on a mortgage with the option to reduce it if market rates fall during the lock period. A typical rate lock provides a borrower with security against an increase during the rate lock period. The float down option specifically allows the borrower to take advantage of a fall in interest rates during the lock period.
Mortgage Recast,"A mortgage recast, also called a loan recast, is a feature of some types of mortgages where remaining monthly payments are recalculated based on a new amortization schedule. During a mortgage recast, the borrower pays a large sum toward their principal, and their mortgage is then recalculated based on the new, lower balance outstanding."
Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR),Mortgage servicing rights (MSR) refer to a contractual agreement in which the right to service an existing mortgage is sold by the original mortgage lender to another party that specializes in the various functions involved with servicing mortgages.

Mothballing,"Mothballing is the deactivation and preservation of equipment or a production facility for possible future use or sale. It can also mean the setting aside of an object or idea for possible reuse or revisiting in the future. Mothballing is common with expensive capital goods, machinery, aircraft, ships, properties, and other assets that are costly to create, have long useful lives, and may be subject to unpredictable market disruptions."
Moving Average (MA),"In statistics, a moving average is a calculation used to analyze data points by creating a series of averages of different subsets of the full data set. In finance, a moving average (MA) is a stock indicator that is commonly used in technical analysis. The reason for calculating the moving average of a stock is to help smooth out the price data by creating a constantly updated average price."
Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD),Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price.

Multiple,"A multiple measures some aspect of a company's financial well-being, determined by dividing one metric by another metric. Metrics are quantitative tools that measure a company's performance. The metric in the numerator is typically larger than the one in the denominator. Investors use multiples to quantify a company's growth, productivity, and efficiency. They use multiples to make comparisons among companies and find the best investment opportunities."
Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangement (MEWA),"A multiple employer welfare arrangement (MEWA) is a system for marketing health and welfare benefits to employers, for their employees. Also described as a ""multiple employer trust (MET),"" a multiple employer welfare arrangement happens when a group of employers combines their contributions in a self-contributing benefits plan for the benefit of their employees."
Multiple Linear Regression (MLR),"Multiple linear regression (MLR), also known simply as multiple regression, is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. The goal of multiple linear regression (MLR) is to model the linear relationship between the explanatory (independent) variables and response (dependent) variable."

Mumbai Interbank Offered Rate (MIBOR),"The Mumbai Interbank Offer Rate (MIBOR) is one iteration of India's interbank rate, which is the rate of interest charged by a bank on a short-term loan to another bank. As India's financial markets have continued to develop, India felt it needed a reference rate for its debt market, which led to the development and introduction of the MIBOR. MIBOR is used in conjunction with the Mumbai interbank bid and forward rates (MIBID and MIFOR) by the central bank of India to set short-term monetary policy."
Municipal Bond,"A municipal bond is a debt security issued by a state, municipality or county to finance its capital expenditures, including the construction of highways, bridges or schools. They can be thought of as loans that investors make to local governments. Municipal bonds are exempt from federal taxes and most state and local taxes, making them especially attractive to people in high income tax brackets."
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB),"The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, (MSRB), is a regulating body which creates rules and policies for investment firms and banks in the issuing and sale of municipal bonds, notes, and other municipal securities.

The markup takes place of interest, which is illegal in Islamic law. As such, murabaha is not an interest-bearing loan (qardh ribawi) but is an acceptable form of credit sale under Islamic law. As with a rent-to-own arrangement, the purchaser does not become the true owner until the loan is fully paid."
Musharakah,"Musharakah is a joint enterprise or partnership structure in Islamic finance in which partners share in the profits and losses of an enterprise. Since Islamic law (Sharia) does not permit profiting from interest in lending, musharakah allows for the financier of a project or company to achieve a return in the form of a portion of the actual profits according to a predetermined ratio. However, unlike a traditional creditor, the financier also will share in any losses should they occur, also on a pro rata basis. Musharakah is a type of shirkah al-amwal (or partnership), which in Arabic means ""sharing."""

Net income after taxes represents the profit or earnings after all expense have been deducted from revenue. Net income after taxes calculation can be shown as both a total dollar amount and a per-share calculation.
Net Interest Income,"Net interest income is a financial performance measure that reflects the difference between the revenue generated from a bank's interest-bearing assets and the expenses associated with paying on its interest-bearing liabilities. A typical bank's assets consist of all forms of personal and commercial loans, mortgages, and securities. The liabilities are interest-bearing customer deposits. The excess revenue that is generated from the interest earned on assets over the interest paid out on deposits is the net interest income."
Net Interest Margin,"Net interest margin (NIM) is a measurement comparing the net interest income a financial firm generates from credit products like loans and mortgages, with the outgoing interest it pays holders of savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs). Expressed as a percentage, the NIM is a profitability indicator that approximates the likelihood of a bank or investment firm thriving over the long haul. This metric helps prospective investors determine whether or not to invest in a given financial services firm by providing visibility into the profitability of their interest income versus their interest expenses."
Net Interest Rate Differential (NIRD),"The net interest rate differential (NIRD), in international currency (forex) markets, is the total difference in the interest rates of two distinct national economies."
Net Internal Rate of Return,Net internal rate of return (net IRR) is a performance measurement equal to the internal rate of return after fees and carried interest are factored in. It is used in capital budgeting and portfolio management to calculate an investment's yield or overall financial quality by calculating an expected rate of return.
Net Interest Rate Spread,The net interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield that a financial institution receives from loans—along with other interest-accruing activities—and the average rate it pays on deposits and borrowings. The net interest rate spread is a key determinant of a financial institution’s profitability (or lack thereof).
Net International Investment Position (NIIP),"A net international investment position (NIIP) measures the gap between a nation’s stock of foreign assets and a foreigner's stock of that nation's assets. Essentially, it can be viewed as a nation’s balance sheet with the rest of the world at a specific point in time."
Net Investment,"Net investment is the total amount of money that a company spends on capital assets, minus the cost of the depreciation of those assets. This figure provides a sense of the real expenditure on durable goods such as plants, equipment, and software that are being used in the company's operations."
Net Investment Income (NII),"Net investment income (NII) is income received from investment assets (before taxes) such as bonds, stocks, mutual funds, loans, and other investments (less related expenses). The individual tax rate on net investment income depends on whether it is interest income, dividend income, or capital gains."
Net Lease,"The term net lease refers to a contractual agreement where a lessee pays a portion or all of the taxes, insurance fees, and maintenance costs for a property in addition to rent. Net leases are commonly used in commercial real estate. In the purest form of a net lease, the tenant is expected to pay for all the costs related to a piece of property as if the tenant were the actual owner. A net lease is the opposite of a gross lease, where the tenant pays a flat rental fee while the landlord is responsible for the other costs."
Net Liquid Assets,"Net liquid assets are a measure of an immediate or near-term liquidity position of a firm, calculated as liquid assets less current liabilities. Liquid assets are cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivables that can be readily converted to cash at their approximate current value."
Net Loss,"A net loss is when expenses exceed the income or total revenue produced for a given period of time. It is sometimes called a net operating loss (NOL). Businesses that have a net loss don't necessarily go bankrupt because they may opt to use their retained earnings or loans to stay afloat. This strategy, however, is only short-term, as a company without profits will not survive in the long-term."
Net National Product (NNP),"Net national product (NNP) is the monetary value of finished goods and services produced by a country's citizens, overseas and domestically, in a given period. It is the equivalent of gross national product (GNP), the total value of a nation's annual output, minus the amount of GNP required to purchase new goods to maintain existing stock, otherwise known as depreciation."
Net-Net,"Net-net is a value investing technique developed by the economist Benjamin Graham, in which a company's stock is valued based solely on its net current assets per share (NCAVPS). Net-net investing thus focuses on current assets, taking cash and cash equivalents at full value, then reducing accounts receivable for doubtful accounts, and reducing inventories to liquidation values. Net-net value is calculated by deducting total liabilities from the adjusted current assets."
Net Neutrality,"Network (Net) neutrality is the concept that all data on the internet should be treated equally by corporations, such as internet service providers (ISPs) and governments, regardless of content, user, platform, application, or device. In other words, net neutrality stipulates that service providers should not slow down nor block content from users."
Net of Tax,The term net of tax refers to the amount left after adjusting for the effects of taxes. Net of tax can be a consideration in any situation where taxation is involved. Individuals and businesses often analyze before- and after-tax values to make investment and purchasing decisions. Net of tax is also an important part of expense analysis when reviewing annual tax filings and the net income of businesses.
Net Operating Income,"Net operating income (NOI) is a calculation used to analyze the profitability of income-generating real estate investments. NOI equals all revenue from the property, minus all reasonably necessary operating expenses."
Net Operating Loss (NOL),"For income tax purposes, a net operating loss (NOL) is the result when a company's allowable deductions exceed its taxable income within a tax period. The NOL can generally be used to offset the company's tax payments in other tax periods through an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax provision called a loss carryforward."
Net Operating Profit After Tax (NOPAT),"Net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) is a financial measure that shows how well a company performed through its core operations, net of taxes. NOPAT is frequently used in economic value added (EVA) calculations and is a more accurate look at operating efficiency for leveraged companies. NOPAT does not include the tax savings many companies get because of existing debt."
Net Operating Profit Less Adjusted Taxes (NOPLAT),"Net operating profit less adjusted taxes (NOPLAT) is a financial metric that calculates a firm's operating profits after adjusting for taxes. By using operating income, or income before taking interest payments into account, NOPLAT serves as a better indicator of operating efficiency than net income."
Net Premium,"Net premium, an insurance industry accounting term, is calculated as the expected present value (PV) of an insurance policy’s benefits, minus the expected PV of future premiums. The net premium calculation does not take into account future expenses associated with maintaining the insurance policy."
Net Premiums Written,"Net premiums written is the sum of premiums written by an insurance company over the course of a period of time, minus premiums ceded to reinsurance companies, plus any reinsurance assumed. Net premiums written represents how much of the premiums the company gets to keep for assuming risk."
Net Present Value (NPV),Net present value (NPV) is the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows over a period of time. NPV is used in capital budgeting and investment planning to analyze the profitability of a projected investment or project.
Net Present Value of Growth Opportunities (NPVGO),The net present value of growth opportunities (NPVGO) is a calculation of the net present value per share of all future cash flows involved with growth opportunities such as new projects or potential acquisitions. The net present value of growth opportunities is used to determine the intrinsic value per share of these growth opportunities in order to determine how much of the firm's current per-share value is determined by them.
Net Present Value Rule,The net present value rule is the idea that company managers and investors should only invest in projects or engage in transactions that have a positive net present value (NPV). They should avoid investing in projects that have a negative net present value. It is a logical outgrowth of net present value theory.
Net Proceeds,"Net proceeds are the amount the seller receives following the sale of an asset after all costs and expenses are deducted from the gross proceeds. Depending on the asset sold, the costs may account for a small percentage of the gross proceeds or a substantial percentage of the gross proceeds. Capital gains taxes are paid on the net proceeds of a sale rather than the gross proceeds."
Net Profit Margin,"The net profit margin, or simply net margin, measures how much net income or profit is generated as a percentage of revenue. It is the ratio of net profits to revenues for a company or business segment. Net profit margin is typically expressed as a percentage but can also be represented in decimal form. The net profit margin illustrates how much of each dollar in revenue collected by a company translates into profit."
Net Realizable Value (NRV),"Net realizable value (NRV) is the value of an asset that can be realized upon its sale, minus a reasonable estimate of the costs associated with the eventual sale or disposal of the asset."
Net Receivables,"Net receivables are the total money owed to a company by its customers minus the money owed that will likely never be paid. Net receivables are often expressed as a percentage, and a higher percentage indicates a business has a greater ability to collect from its customers. For example, if a company estimates that 2% of its sales are never going to be paid, net receivables equal 98% (100% - 2%) of the accounts receivable (AR)."
Net Sales,"Net sales is the sum of a company's gross sales minus its returns, allowances, and discounts. Net sales calculations are not always transparent externally. They can often be factored into the reporting of top line revenues reported on the income statement."
Net Settlement,Net settlement is a bank's routine resolution of the day's transactions at the end of the business day.
Net Tangible Assets,"Net tangible assets are calculated as the total assets of a company, minus any intangible assets such as goodwill, patents, and trademarks, less all liabilities and the par value of preferred stock. In other words, its focus is on physical assets such as property, plant, and equipment, as well as inventories and cash instruments."
Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA),"Some companies offer the benefit of employees owning stock in the employer company. The idea is that this creates an ownership mentality in the employees, even if they own a very small percentage of total shares. The net unrealized appreciation (NUA) is the difference in value between the average cost basis of shares of employer stock and the current market value of the shares.﻿ The NUA is important if you are distributing highly appreciated employer stock from your tax-deferred employer-sponsored retirement plan, such as a 401(k)."
Net Volume,"Net volume is a technical indicator calculated by subtracting a security's uptick volume by its downtick volume over a specified period of time. Unlike standard volume, the indicator differentiates whether the market sentiment is leaning bullish or bearish. Net volume is typically plotted below the price chart with bars for each period indicating the net volume reading for that period."
Net Worth,"Net worth is the value of the assets a person or corporation owns, minus the liabilities they owe. It is an important metric to gauge a company's health, providing a useful snapshot of its current financial position."
Netback,Netback is a summary of all costs associated with bringing one unit of oil to the marketplace and the revenues from the sale of all the products generated from that same unit. It's expressed as gross profit per barrel.
Network Effect,"The network effect is a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value of a good or service. The Internet is an example of the network effect. Initially, there were few users on the Internet since it was of little value to anyone outside of the military and some research scientists."

Neural Network,"A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. In this sense, neural networks refer to systems of neurons, either organic or artificial in nature. Neural networks can adapt to changing input; so the network generates the best possible result without needing to redesign the output criteria. The concept of neural networks, which has its roots in artificial intelligence, is swiftly gaining popularity in the development of trading systems."
Neutral,"Neutral describes a position taken in a market that is neither bullish nor bearish. In other words, it is insensitive to the direction of the market's price. If an investor has a neutral opinion—believing that a security or index will neither increase nor decrease in value in the near future—they can undertake an option strategy that may profit despite the lack of movement in the underlying security."
Neutrality Of Money,"The neutrality of money, also called neutral money, is an economic theory stating that changes in the money supply only affect nominal variables and not real variables. In other words, the amount of money printed by the Federal Reserve (Fed) and central banks can impact prices and wages but not the output or structure of the economy."
New Deal,"The New Deal was a comprehensive and broad set of government-directed projects introduced by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in an attempt to help the United States economy emerge from the Great Depression.

Nominal Value,"Nominal value of a security, often referred to as face or par value, is its redemption price and is normally stated on the front of that security. With respect to bonds and stocks, it is the stated value of an issued security, as opposed to its market value.

Non-Controlling Interest,"A non-controlling interest, also known as a minority interest, is an ownership position wherein a shareholder owns less than 50% of outstanding shares and has no control over decisions. Non-controlling interests are measured at the net asset value of entities and do not account for potential voting rights."
Non-Covered Security,"A non-covered security is an SEC designation under which the cost basis of securities that are small and of limited scope may not be reported to the IRS. The adjusted cost basis of non-covered securities is only reported to the taxpayer, and not the IRS.﻿﻿"
Non-Deliverable Forward (NDF),"A non-deliverable forward (NDF) is a cash-settled, and usually short-term, forward contract. The notional amount is never exchanged, hence the name ""non-deliverable."" Two parties agree to take opposite sides of a transaction for a set amount of money—at a contracted rate, in the case of a currency NDF. This means that counterparties settle the difference between contracted NDF price and the prevailing spot price. The profit or loss is calculated on the notional amount of the agreement by taking the difference between the agreed-upon rate and the spot rate at the time of settlement."
Non-Deliverable Swap (NDS),"A non-deliverable swap (NDS) is a variation on a currency swap between major and minor currencies that is restricted or not convertible. This means that there is no actual delivery of the two currencies involved in the swap, unlike a typical currency swap where there is physical exchange of currency flows.

These regulations are created by the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)."
Non-Farm Payroll,"Nonfarm payrolls is the measure of the number of workers in the U.S. excluding farm workers and workers in a handful of other job classifications. This is measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which surveys private and government entities throughout the U.S. about their payrolls. The BLS reports the nonfarm payroll numbers to the public on a monthly basis through the closely followed “Employment Situation” report."
Non-GAAP Earnings,"Non-GAAP earnings are an alternative accounting method used to measure the earnings of a company.

Institutions charge fees that generate non-interest income as a way of increasing revenue and ensuring liquidity in the event of increased default rates."
Non-Issuer Transaction,"A non-issuer transaction is a transaction involving a security that is not directly or indirectly executed for the benefit of the issuing company. Most deals that occur on the secondary market, such as stock exchanges, involve non-issuer transactions; with the exception of initial public offerings (IPOs); secondary offerings; or share buybacks that will involve the issuer."

Non-Marketable Security,"A non-marketable security is an asset that is difficult to buy or sell due to the fact that they are not traded on any major secondary market exchanges. Such securities, often forms of debt or fixed-income securities, are usually only bought and sold through private transactions or in an over-the-counter (OTC) market."
Non-Member Banks,"Non-member banks are banks that are not members of the U.S. Federal Reserve System. As with member banks, non-member banks are subject to reserve requirements, which they have to maintain by placing a percentage of their deposits at a Federal Reserve Bank. Although non-member banks are not required to purchase stock in their district Federal Reserve banks, they still have access to services offered by the Federal Reserve, such as its discount window on the same terms as member banks."

Non-Operating Asset,"A non-operating asset is a class of assets that are not essential to the ongoing operations of a business but may still generate income or provide a return on investment (ROI). These assets are listed on a company's balance sheet along with its operating assets, and they may or may not be broken out separately."
Non-Operating Expense,"A non-operating expense is a business expense unrelated to the core operations.

Regulated non-purpose loans can be offered by brokerages and financial institutions with some specific government-regulatory documentation requirements.﻿﻿
Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation (NQDC),"A non-qualified deferred compensation is compensation that has been earned by an employee but not yet received from their employer.

Non-Qualified Plan,"A nonqualified plan is a type of tax-deferred, employer-sponsored retirement plan that falls outside of Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) guidelines. Nonqualified plans are designed to meet specialized retirement needs for key executives and other select employees and can act as recruitment or employee retention tools.

Non-Qualified Stock Option (NSO),A non-qualified stock option (NSO) is a type of employee stock option wherein you pay ordinary income tax on the difference between the grant price and the price at which you exercise the option.﻿﻿
Non-Qualifying Investment,"A non-qualifying investment is an investment that does not qualify for any level of tax-deferred or tax-exempt status. Investments of this sort are made with after-tax money. They are purchased and held in tax-deferred accounts, plans, or trusts. Returns from these investments are taxed on an annual"
Non-Recourse Debt,"Non-recourse debt is a type of loan secured by collateral, which is usually property. If the borrower defaults, the issuer can seize the collateral but cannot seek out the borrower for any further compensation, even if the collateral does not cover the full value of the defaulted amount. This is one instance where the borrower does not have personal liability for the loan."
Non-Recourse Finance,Non-recourse finance is a type of commercial lending that entitles the lender to repayment only from the profits of the project the loan is funding and not from any other assets of the borrower. Such loans are generally secured by collateral.
Non-Refundable Tax Credit,"A non-refundable tax credit is a tax credit that can only reduce a taxpayer’s liability to zero.﻿﻿ Any amount that remains from the credit is automatically forfeited by the taxpayer. A nonrefundable credit can also be referred to as a wastable tax credit, which may be contrasted with refundable tax credits."

Non-Security,"A non-security is an alternative investment that is not traded on a public exchange as stocks and bonds are. Assets such as art, rare coins, life insurance, gold, and diamonds all are non-securities."
Non-Sufficient Funds,"The term non-sufficient funds (NSF), or insufficient funds, refers to the status of a checking account that does not have enough money to cover transactions. NSF also describes the fee charged when a check is presented but cannot be covered by the balance in the account. You may see a “non-sufficient funds” or “insufficient funds” notice on a bank statement or at an ATM terminal (or on a receipt) when attempting to withdraw more money than your account holds."
Non-Taxable Distribution,"A non-taxable distribution is a payment to shareholders. It is similar to a dividend, but it represents a share of a company's capital rather than its earnings. Contrary to what the name might imply, it's not really non-taxable. It's just not taxed until the investor sells the stock of the company that issued the distribution. Non-taxable distributions reduce the basis of the stock."
Non-Traded REIT,Non-traded REITs are not listed on public exchanges and can provide retail investors access to inaccessible real estate investments with tax benefits.
Nonaccrual Experience Method (NAE),"The Nonaccrual Experience Method (NAE) is an accounting procedure allowed by the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) for handling bad debts.

The company in question also must have average annual gross receipts for any three prior tax years of less than $5 million."
Nonaccrual Loan,"A nonaccrual loan is a lender's term for an unsecured loan whose payment is 90 days or more overdue. The loan is no longer generating its stated interest rate because no payment has been made by the borrower. It is, therefore, a nonperforming loan."
Noncallable,"Noncallable security is a financial security that cannot be redeemed early by the issuer except with the payment of a penalty. The issuer of a noncallable bond subjects itself to interest rate risk because, at issuance, it locks in the interest rate it will pay until the security matures. If interest rates decline, the issuer must continue paying the higher rate until the security matures."
Noncancellable Insurance Policy,"A noncancellable insurance policy is a life or disability insurance policy that an insurance company can’t cancel, increase the premiums on, or reduce the benefits of for as long as the customer pays the premiums."
Nonce,"A nonce is an abbreviation for ""number only used once,"" which, in the context of cryptocurrency mining, is a number added to a hashed—or encrypted—block in a blockchain that, when rehashed, meets the difficulty level restrictions.

Nonconforming Mortgage,"A nonconforming mortgage is a mortgage that does not meet the guidelines of government-sponsored enterprises (GSE) such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and, therefore, cannot be sold to them. GSE guidelines consist of a maximum loan amount, suitable properties, down payment requirements, and credit requirements, among other factors."
Noncumulative,"The term ""noncumulative"" describes a type of preferred stock that does not pay stockholders any unpaid or omitted dividends. Preferred stock shares are issued with pre-established dividend rates, which may either be stated as a dollar amount or as a percentage of the par value. If the corporation chooses not to pay dividends in a given year, investors forfeit the right to claim any of the unpaid dividends in the future."
Noncurrent Assets,"Noncurrent assets are a company's long-term investments for which the full value will not be realized within the accounting year. They are typically highly illiquid, meaning these assets cannot easily be converted into cash. Examples of noncurrent assets include investments, intellectual property, real estate, and equipment. Noncurrent assets appear on a company's balance sheet."
Noncurrent Liability,"Noncurrent liabilities, also called long-term liabilities or long-term debts, are long-term financial obligations listed on a company’s balance sheet. These liabilities have obligations that become due beyond twelve months in the future, as opposed to current liabilities which are short-term debts with maturity dates within the following twelve month period."
Nonelective Contribution,Nonelective contributions are funds employers choose to direct toward their eligible workers' employer-sponsored retirement plans regardless if employees make their own contributions. These contributions come directly from the employer and are not deducted from employees' salaries.

Nonfinancial Asset,"A nonfinancial asset is an asset that derives its value from its physical traits. Examples include real estate and vehicles. It also includes all intellectual property, such as patents and trademarks. The classification of possessions as nonfinancial assets is important to businesses as these items appear on a company's balance sheet and determine a multitude of factors, such as a company's market value and debt profile."
Nonforfeiture Clause,"A nonforfeiture (sometimes hyphenated) clause is an insurance policy clause stipulating that an insured party can receive full or partial benefits or a partial refund of premiums after a lapse due to non-payment. Standard life insurance and long-term care insurance may have nonforfeiture clauses.

Nonmonetary Assets,"Nonmonetary assets are items a company holds for which it is not possible to precisely determine a dollar value. These are assets whose dollar value may fluctuate substantially over time. A company may need to change its nonmonetary assets as the assets wear out or become obsolete. An example of this would be factory equipment and vehicles. Generally speaking, nonmonetary assets are assets that appear on the balance sheet but are not readily or easily convertible into cash or cash equivalents."
Nonparametric Method,The nonparametric method refers to a type of statistic that does not make any assumptions about the characteristics of the sample (its parameters) or whether the observed data is quantitative or qualitative.
Nonparametric Statistics,"Nonparametric statistics refers to a statistical method in which the data are not assumed to come from prescribed models that are determined by a small number of parameters; examples of such models include the normal distribution model and the linear regression model. Nonparametric statistics sometimes uses data that is ordinal, meaning it does not rely on numbers, but rather on a ranking or order of sorts. For example, a survey conveying consumer preferences ranging from like to dislike would be considered ordinal data."
Nonpassive Income and Losses,"Nonpassive income and losses constitute any income or losses that cannot be classified as passive. Nonpassive income includes any active income, such as wages, business income, or investment income. Nonpassive losses include losses incurred in the active management of a business. Nonpassive income and losses are usually declarable and deductible in the year incurred."
Nonperforming Asset,"A nonperforming asset (NPA) is a debt instrument where the borrower has not made any previously agreed upon interest and principal repayments to the designated lender for an extended period of time. The nonperforming asset is, therefore, not yielding any income to the lender in the form of interest payments."
Nonperforming Loan (NPL),"A nonperforming loan (NPL) is a loan in which the borrower is in default due to the fact that they have not made the scheduled payments for a specified period. Although the exact elements of nonperforming status can vary depending on the specific loan's terms, ""no payment"" is usually defined as zero payments of either principal or interest. The specified period also varies, depending on the industry and the type of loan. Generally, however, the period is 90 days or 180 days."
Nonprofit Organization (NPO),"A nonprofit organization is a business that has been granted tax-exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) because it furthers a social cause and provides a public benefit. Donations made to a nonprofit organization are typically tax-deductible to individuals and businesses that make them, and the nonprofit itself pays no tax on the received donations or on any other money earned through fundraising activities. Nonprofit organizations are sometimes called NPOs or 501(c)(3) organizations based on the section of the tax code that permits them to operate.﻿﻿"

Nontariff Barrier,"A nontariff barrier is a way to restrict trade using trade barriers in a form other than a tariff. Nontariff barriers include quotas, embargoes, sanctions, and levies. As part of their political or economic strategy, some countries frequently use nontariff barriers to restrict the amount of trade they conduct with other countries."
Nordic Model Definiition,"The Nordic model is the combination of social welfare and economic systems adopted by Nordic countries. It combines features of capitalism, such as a market economy and economic efficiency, with social benefits, such as state pensions and income distribution. The Nordic model, also known as the Scandinavian model, is most commonly associated with the countries of Scandinavia: Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, and Iceland."
Normal-Course Issuer Bid (NCIB),A normal-course issuer bid is a Canadian term for a public company's repurchase of its own stock in order to cancel it. A company is allowed to repurchase between 5% and 10% of its shares depending on how the transaction is conducted.
Normal Good,"A normal good is a good that experiences an increase in its demand due to a rise in consumers' income. In other words, if there's an increase in wages, demand for normal goods increases while conversely, wage declines or layoffs lead to a reduction in demand."
Normal Profit,Normal profit is a profit metric that takes into consideration both explicit and implicit costs. It may be viewed in conjunction with economic profit. Normal profit occurs when the difference between a company’s total revenue and combined explicit and implicit costs are equal to zero.
Normal Retirement Age (NRA),"The full retirement age, also known as the “normal retirement age,” is the age at which people can receive full retirement benefits upon leaving the workforce. In the U.S., for example, the full retirement age for receiving Social Security benefits is 67 years of age for persons born in 1960 or after, 66 for people born from 1943 to 1954, and 66 and two, four, six, eight, or 10 months for people born from 1955 to 1959 (the age increases by two months each successive year). Claiming benefits prior to your full retirement age will reduce your benefit, while claiming after your FRA will increase them by 8% annually with the maximum benefit occurring at age 70.﻿﻿"
Normal Yield Curve,"The normal yield curve is a yield curve in which short-term debt instruments have a lower yield than long-term debt instruments of the same credit quality. This gives the yield curve an upward slope. This is the most often seen yield curve shape, and it's sometimes referred to as the ""positive yield curve."""
Normalized Earnings,"Normalized earnings are adjusted to remove the effects of seasonality, revenue, and expenses that are unusual or one-time influences. Normalized earnings help business owners, financial analysts, and other stakeholders understand a company's true earnings from its normal operations. An example of this normalization would be to remove a land sale from a retail firm's financial statements in which a large capital gain was realized, as selling products—not selling land—is the company's real business."
Normative Economics,"Normative economics is a perspective on economics that reflects normative, or ideologically prescriptive judgments toward economic development, investment projects, statements, and scenarios."
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),"The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was implemented to promote trade between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.

North American Industry Classification System (NAICS),"The North American Industry Classification System is a business-classification system developed through a partnership among the United States, Mexico and Canada. This classification system facilitates the comparison of statistics of all business activities across North America. Companies are classified and separated into industries that are defined by the same or similar production processes. This system should not be confused with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) or the National Association of Investors Corp. (NAIC)."
North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA),"The North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) is an organization of securities regulators whose aim is to protect investors from fraud. Founded in 1919 in the U.S. state of Kansas, its membership of over 60 securities administrators from across North America works to protect customers of investment advice or securities as part of a complementary regulatory system that works at the federal, state/provincial, and industry levels.﻿﻿"

The bank issued a total of eight series of banknotes, including the October 2018, issued of a new 50-krone and 500-krone bills. Consumers may still use the 50-krone and 500-krone banknotes from the previous series until 18 October 2019."
Nostro Account,"A nostro account refers to an account that a bank holds in a foreign currency in another bank. Nostros, a term derived from the Latin word for ""ours,"" are frequently used to facilitate foreign exchange and trade transactions.

Notice to Creditors,The notice to creditors is a public notice usually posted in a local newspaper by a trust or estate's executor as part of the probate of the estate of a deceased person. The notice serves as the official notification to both creditors and debtors of the probate of a deceased individual’s estate and may run for a period of weeks depending on state laws.
Notional Principal Amount,"The notional principal amount, in an interest rate swap, is the predetermined dollar amounts, or principal, on which the exchanged interest payments are based. The notional principal never changes hands in the transaction, which is why it is considered notional, or theoretical. Neither party pays nor receives the notional principal amount at any time; only interest rate payments change hands."
Notional Value,"Notional value is a term often used to value the underlying asset in a derivatives trade. It can be the total value of a position, how much value a position controls, or an agreed-upon amount in a contract.

According to its creators, Obelisk also reduces the need for mining, significantly improves transaction speed, and delivers enhanced security."
Objective Probability,"Objective probability refers to the chances or the odds that an event will occur based on the analysis of concrete measures rather than hunches or guesswork. Each measure is a recorded observation, a hard fact, or part of a long history of collected data. The probability estimate is computed using mathematical equations that manipulate the data to determine the likelihood of an independent event occurring. An independent event is an event whose outcome is not influenced by prior events. Subjective probability, by contrast, may utilize some method of data analysis but also uses guesstimates or intuition to determine the chances of a specific outcome."
Obligation,"An obligation in finance is the responsibility of a party to meet the terms of a contract. If an obligation is not met, the legal system often provides recourse for the injured party. Financial obligations are the backbone of our economy. Trusting that a contract will be adhered to helps create a stable, healthy society."

Odd Lot,An odd lot is an order amount for a security that is less than the normal unit of trading for that particular asset. Odd lots are considered to be anything less than the standard 100 shares for stocks. Trading commissions for odd lots are generally higher on a percentage basis than those for standard lots since most brokerage firms have a fixed minimum commission level for undertaking such transactions.
Odd Lot Theory,"The odd lot theory is a technical analysis hypothesis based on the assumption that the small individual investor is usually wrong and that individual investors are more likely to generate odd-lot sales. Therefore, if odd lot sales are up and small investors are selling a stock, it is probably a good time to buy, and when odd-lot purchases are up, it may indicate a good time to sell."
Odious Debt,"Odious debt, also known as illegitimate debt, is when a country's government changes and the successor government does not want to pay debts incurred by the previous government. Usually, successor governments argue that the previous government misappropriated money it had borrowed and that they should not be held responsible for the previous regime’s alleged misdeeds."

Operating Lease,An operating lease is a contract that allows for the use of an asset but does not convey ownership rights of the asset.
Operating Leverage,Operating leverage is a cost-accounting formula that measures the degree to which a firm or project can increase operating income by increasing revenue. A business that generates sales with a high gross margin and low variable costs has high operating leverage.
Operating Loss (OL),"An operating loss occurs when a company's operating expenses exceed gross profits (or revenues in the case of a service-oriented company). An operating loss does not consider the effects of interest income, interest expense, extraordinary gains or losses, or income or losses from equity investments or taxes. These items are ""below the line,"" meaning they are added or subtracted after the operating loss (or income, if positive) to arrive at net income. If there is an operating loss, there is usually a net income loss unless an extraordinary gain (e.g., sale of an asset) was recorded during the accounting period."
Operating Margin,"Operating margin measures how much profit a company makes on a dollar of sales after paying for variable costs of production, such as wages and raw materials, but before paying interest or tax. It is calculated by dividing a company’s operating income by its net sales. Higher ratios are generally better, illustrating the company is efficient in its operations and is good at turning sales into profits."
Operating Profit,"A company's operating profit is its total earnings from its core business functions for a given period, excluding the deduction of interest and taxes. It also excludes any profits earned from ancillary investments, such as earnings from other businesses that a company has a part interest in."
Operating Ratio (OPEX),"The operating ratio shows the efficiency of a company's management by comparing the total operating expense (OPEX) of a company to net sales. The operating ratio shows how efficient a company's management is at keeping costs low while generating revenue or sales. The smaller the ratio, the more efficient the company is at generating revenue vs. total expenses."
Operating Revenue,Operating revenue is the revenue that a company generates from its primary business activities.
Operation Twist,Operation Twist is a Federal Reserve (Fed) monetary policy initiative used in the past to lower long-term interest rates to further stimulate the U.S. economy when traditional monetary tools were lacking via the timed purchase and sale of U.S. Treasuries of different maturities.
Operational Efficiency,"Operational efficiency is primarily a metric that measures the efficiency of profit earned as a function of operating costs. The greater the operational efficiency, the more profitable a firm or investment is. This is because the entity is able to generate greater income or returns for the same or lower cost than an alternative."
Operational Risk,"Operational risk summarizes the uncertainties and hazards a company faces when it attempts to do its day-to-day business activities within a given field or industry. A type of business risk, it can result from breakdowns in internal procedures, people and systems—as opposed to problems incurred from external forces, such as political or economic events, or inherent to the entire market or market segment, known as systematic risk."
Operational Target,"The operating target or operational target is a specific interest rate or other financial metric that a central bank chooses as its primary intermediate target to guide open market operations and other monetary policy. The central bank sets a specific target rate or number for it’s operating target, and then executes policy to loosen or tighten credit and monetary conditions to achieve and maintain the target at the specified rate or level."
Operations Management,Operations management (OM) is the administration of business practices to create the highest level of efficiency possible within an organization. It is concerned with converting materials and labor into goods and services as efficiently as possible to maximize the profit of an organization. Operations management teams attempt to balance costs with revenue to achieve the highest net operating profit possible.
Oprah Effect,"The Oprah Effect refers to the boost in sales that followed an endorsement on The Oprah Winfrey Show, which aired on TV for 25 years. A recommendation from Oprah, the queen of talk shows, turned many fashion and lifestyle products into multimillion-dollar companies."
Optimal Capital Structure,"The optimal capital structure of a firm is the best mix of debt and equity financing that maximizes a company’s market value while minimizing its cost of capital. In theory, debt financing offers the lowest cost of capital due to its tax deductibility. However, too much debt increases the financial risk to shareholders and the return on equity that they require. Thus, companies have to find the optimal point at which the marginal benefit of debt equals the marginal cost."
Optimal Currency Area,"An optimal currency area (OCA) is the geographic area in which a single currency would create the greatest economic benefit. While traditionally each country has maintained its own separate national currency, work by Robert Mundell in the 1960s theorized that this might not be the most efficient economic arrangement."
Optimization,Optimization is the process of making a trading system more effective by adjusting the variables used for technical analysis.
Optimized Portfolio As Listed Securities (OPALS),Optimized portfolio as listed securities is a single-country equity index that contains fewer holdings than the benchmarked index. Optimized portfolio as listed securities was created by Morgan Stanley in 1994. It is seen as a predecessor to the popularity of exchange-traded funds.
Optimum Currency Area (OCA) Theory,"Optimum currency area theory (OCA) states that specific areas not bounded by national borders would benefit from a common currency. In other words, geographic regions may be better off using the same currency instead of each country within that geographic region using its own currency."
Option Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (Option ARM),"An option adjustable-rate mortgage (option ARM) is a type of ARM mortgage where the borrower has several options as to which type of payment is made to the lender. In addition to having the choice of making payments of interest and principal that amounts to those made in conventional mortgages, option ARMs also have alternative payment options where the mortgagor can make significantly smaller payments by making interest-only payments or minimum payments."
Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS),"The option-adjusted spread (OAS) is the measurement of the spread of a fixed-income security rate and the risk-free rate of return, which is then adjusted to take into account an embedded option. Typically, an analyst uses Treasury yields for the risk-free rate. The spread is added to the fixed-income security price to make the risk-free bond price the same as the bond."
Option Agreement,An option agreement is a legally binding contract between two entities outlining each counterparty's responsibilities to the other.
Option Chain,"An options chain, also known as an option matrix, is a listing of all available options contracts for a given security.

The chain will typically be categorized by expiration date and segmented by calls vs. puts."
Option Cycle,Option cycle refers to the expiration dates that apply to the different classes of options. A newly listed option is assigned a cycle randomly to broadly distribute options across varying time frames. It is also known as an expiration cycle.

Employees who get into the startup early will usually receive a greater percentage of the option pool than employees who arrive later."
Option Premium,An option premium is the current market price of an option contract. It is thus the income received by the seller (writer) of an option contract to another party. In-the-money option premiums are composed of two factors: intrinsic and extrinsic value. Out-of-the-money options' premiums consist solely of extrinsic value.
Option Pricing Theory,"Option pricing theory estimates a value of an options contract by assigning a price, known as a premium, based on the calculated probability that the contract will finish in the money (ITM) at expiration. Essentially, option pricing theory provides an evaluation of an option's fair value, which traders incorporate into their strategies."
Optionable Stock,"An optionable stock is one where the stock has the necessary liquidity such that a market maker, like a bank or an accredited financial institution, lists that stock's options for trading."
Options,"Options are financial instruments that are derivatives based on the value of underlying securities such as stocks. An options contract offers the buyer the opportunity to buy or sell—depending on the type of contract they hold—the underlying asset. Unlike futures, the holder is not required to buy or sell the asset if they choose not to."
Options Backdating,"Options backdating is the process of granting an employee stock option (ESO) that is dated before its actual issuance. In this way, the exercise (strike) price of the granted option can be set at a lower price than that of the company's stock price at the granting date. This process makes the granted option ""in the money"" (ITM) and therefore of greater value to the holder."
Options Clearing Corporation (OCC),"The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) is an organization that acts as both the issuer and guarantor for options and futures contracts. The largest equity derivatives clearing organization in the world, it operates under the jurisdiction of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)."

Options Industry Council (OIC),"The term Options Industry Council (OIC) refers to a cooperative that helps educate investors and financial advisers about the benefits and risks of exchange-traded equity options. The organization was established in 1992 by U.S. options exchanges and the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC). Its mission is to increase awareness of these options among investors through education and practical knowledge. The OIC is sponsored by a variety of corporations, including the International Securities Exchange (ISE)."
Options on Futures,"An option on a futures contract gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specific futures contract at a strike price on or before the option's expiration date. These work similarly to stock options, but differ in that the underlying security is a futures contract."
Options Price Reporting Authority (OPRA),The Options Price Reporting Authority (OPRA) is a committee of representatives from participating securities exchanges responsible for providing last-sale options quotations and information from the participating exchanges.
Oracle of Omaha,"The Oracle of Omaha is a nickname for Warren Buffett, who is arguably one of the greatest investors of all time. Buffett is the chair and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, a company that he became the controlling shareholder of in the mid-1960s."

Once an order is placed, it follows a process of order execution."
Order Audit Trail System (OATS),"The Order Audit Trail System (OATS) is an automated computer system established by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). It is used to record information relating to orders, quotes, and other related trade data from all equities traded on the National Market System (NMS), including over-the-counter (OTC) stocks. This system simplifies an order's progression from the initial receipt of the order to its eventual execution or cancellation, for easy tracking or auditing purposes."
Order Book,"The term order book refers to an electronic list of buy and sell orders for a specific security or financial instrument organized by price level. An order book lists the number of shares being bid on or offered at each price point, or market depth. It also identifies the market participants behind the buy and sell orders, though some choose to remain anonymous. These lists help traders and also improve market transparency because they provide valuable trading information."
Order Driven Market,"An order-driven market is a financial market where all buyers and sellers display the prices at which they wish to buy or sell a particular security, as well as the amounts of the security desired to be bought or sold. This kind of trading environment is the opposite of a quote-driven market, which only displays bids and asks of designated market makers and specialists for the specific security that is being traded."
Order Imbalance,"Order imbalance is a situation resulting from an excess of buy or sell orders for a specific security on a trading exchange, making it impossible to match the orders of buyers and sellers. For securities that are overseen by a market maker or specialist, shares may be brought in from a specified reserve to add liquidity, temporarily clearing out excess orders from the inventory so that the trading in the security can resume at an orderly level. Extreme cases of order imbalance may cause suspension of trading until the imbalance is resolved."
Order Management Systems (OMS),"An order management system (OMS) is an electronic system developed to execute securities orders in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Brokers and dealers use order management systems when filling orders for various types of securities and can track the progress of each order throughout the system. An OMS is also referred to as a ""trade order management system."""
Order Paper,"An order paper, or order instrument, is a negotiable instrument that is payable to a specified person or its assignee. An instrument such as an order paper is negotiable only if it is payable to the order of a specified person; meaning that it must designate an individual's name to be paid out. It is the opposite of a bearer instrument, which does not require the designation of an individual to be paid out."
Order Protection Rule,"The Order Protection Rule is one of the four main provisions of the Regulation National Market System (NMS). The rule is meant to ensure that investors receive an execution price that is equivalent to what is being quoted on any other exchange where the security is traded. The rule eliminates the possibility of orders being traded through, which means executed at a suboptimal price.﻿﻿"
Orderly Market,"An orderly market is any market in which supply and demand are reasonably equal. An orderly market is said to be in a state of equilibrium. This term can also refer to a site of exchange for goods, services, or financial securities that are traded in a fair, reliable, secure, accurate, and efficient way. Orderly markets contribute to economic growth."

Ordinary Annuity,"An ordinary annuity is a series of equal payments made at the end of consecutive periods over a fixed length of time. While the payments in an ordinary annuity can be made as frequently as every week, in practice they are generally made monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. The opposite of an ordinary annuity is an annuity due, in which payments are made at the beginning of each period. These two series of payments are not the same as the financial product known as an annuity, though they are related."

Ordinary Loss,An ordinary loss is loss realized by a taxpayer when expenses exceed revenues in normal business operations. Ordinary losses are those losses incurred by a taxpayer which are not capital losses. An ordinary loss is fully deductible to offset income thereby reducing the tax owed by a taxpayer.
Ordinary Shares of Stock,"Ordinary shares, also called common shares, are stocks sold on a public exchange. Each share of stock generally gives its owner the right to one vote at a company shareholders' meeting. Unlike in the case of preferred shares, the owner of ordinary shares is not guaranteed a dividend."
Organic Growth,"Organic growth is the growth a company achieves by increasing output and enhancing sales internally. This does not include profits or growth attributable to mergers and acquisitions but rather an increase in sales and expansion through the company's own resources. Organic growth stands in contrast to inorganic growth, which is growth related to activities outside a business's own operations."
Organic Reserve Replacement,"Organic reserve replacement is the supply of oil reserves which an oil company acquires through exploration and production, rather than by purchasing a proven reserve. Recoverable reserves are oil and gas reserves which are economically and technically feasible to extract at the existing price of oil, within current economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations."
Organic Sales,Organic sales are revenues generated from within a company. Organic sales encompass those streams of revenues that are a direct result of the firm's existing operations as opposed to revenues that have been acquired through the purchase of another company or business unit in the past year. (Acquired businesses are typically integrated within 12 months post-closing.) The sale or disposal of business lines are also netted out of a total sales figure to derive organic sales. Measuring organic sales is important because it can show the amount of growth that's the direct result of a company's business plan or sales strategy.

Oscillator,"An oscillator is a technical analysis tool that constructs high and low bands between two extreme values, and then builds a trend indicator that fluctuates within these bounds. Traders use the trend indicator to discover short-term overbought or oversold conditions. When the value of the oscillator approaches the upper extreme value, technical analysts interpret that information to mean that the asset is overbought, and as it approaches the lower extreme, technicians consider the asset to be oversold."

Other Current Assets (OCA),"Other current assets (OCA) is a category of things of value that a company owns, benefits from, or uses to generate income that can be converted into cash within one business cycle. They are referred to as “other” because they are uncommon or insignificant, unlike typical current asset items such as cash, securities, accounts receivable, inventory, and prepaid expenses."
Other Current Liabilities,"Other current liabilities, in financial accounting, are categories of short-term debt that are lumped together on the liabilities side of the balance sheet. The term ""current liabilities"" refers to items of short-term debt that a firm must pay within 12 months. To that, companies add the word ""other"" to describe those current liabilities that are not significant enough to identify separately on their own lines in financial statements, so they are grouped together as ""other current liabilities."""
Other Long-Term Liabilities,Other long-term liabilities is a line item on a balance sheet that lumps together obligations that are not due within 12 months. These debts that are less urgent to repay are a part of their total liabilities but are categorized as “other” when the company doesn’t deem them important enough to warrant individual identification.

Overall Liquidity Ratio,"The overall liquidity ratio is the measurement of a company's capacity to pay its outstanding liabilities with its assets on hand. The overall liquidity ratio is calculated by dividing total assets by the difference between its total liabilities and conditional reserves. This ratio is used in the insurance industry, as well as in the analysis of financial institutions."
Overall Turnover,"Overall turnover is a synonym for a company’s total revenues. It is a term that is most commonly used in Europe and Asia.

The option can be exercised within 30 days of the offering, and it does not have to be exercised on the same day."
Overbought,"Overbought is a term used when a security is believed to be trading at a level above its intrinsic or fair value. Overbought generally describes recent or short-term movement in the price of the security, and reflects an expectation that the market will correct the price in the near future.

Overcapitalization,"Overcapitalization occurs when a company has issued more in debt and equity than its assets are worth. If this is the case, the market value of the company is less than the total capitalized value of the company. An overcapitalized company might be paying more in interest and dividend payments than it can sustain in the long term."
Overcast,"An overcast is a type of forecasting error that occurs when an estimated metric, such as future cash flows, performance levels, or production, is forecast too high. Overcasting thus is when the estimated value turns out to be above the realized or actual value."

Overextension,"The term ""overextension"" refers to a situation in finance in which an individual or corporation has more debt than they can handle and repay. Consumers who must use more than a third of their net income to repay debt are generally considered to be overextended. They may need to consolidate their debts into a single loan. Granting more credit to overextended consumers or companies can be a great risk to lenders. Being overextended also represents excessive leverage in a trader or investor's account equity and their buying power for securities."

Overhead Rate,"The overhead rate is a cost allocated to the production of a product or service. Overhead costs are expenses that are not directly tied to production such as the cost of the corporate office. To allocate overhead costs, an overhead rate is applied to the direct costs tied to production by spreading or allocating the overhead costs based on specific measures."
Overhead Ratio,An overhead ratio is a measurement of the operating costs of doing business compared to the company's income. A low overhead ratio indicates that a company is minimizing business expenses that are not directly related to production.

Overlay portfolio management makes sure the investor’s strategies are implemented and coordinated successfully.
Overleveraged,"A business is said to be overleveraged when it is carrying too much debt when compared to its operating cash flows and equity. An overleveraged company has difficulty in paying its interest and principal payments and is often unable to pay its operating expenses because of excessive costs due to its debt burden, which often leads to a downward financial spiral. This results in the company having to borrow more to stay in operation, and the problem gets worse. This spiral usually ends when a company restructures its debt or files for bankruptcy protection."

Oversold,"The term oversold refers to a condition where an asset has traded lower in price and has the potential for a price bounce. An oversold condition can last for a long time, and therefore being oversold doesn't mean a price rally will come soon, or at all. Many technical indicators identify oversold and overbought levels. These indicators base their assessment on where the price is currently trading relative to prior prices. Fundamentals can also be used to assess whether an asset is potentially oversold and has deviated from its typical value metrics."
Oversubscribed,"Oversubscribed is a term used for when the demand for a new issue of securities, such as an IPO's shares, is greater than the number of securities offered. When a new issue is oversubscribed, underwriters or other financial entities offering the security can adjust the price upward or offer more securities to reflect the higher-than-anticipated demand."
Oversubscription Privilege,An oversubscription privilege gets extended to a company’s shareholders on the issuance of a rights or warrants offering. The privilege allows shareholders to purchase any shares remaining after other shareholders have had an opportunity to purchase them.
Oversupply,"Oversupply is an excessive amount of a product. Oversupply results when demand is lower than supply, resulting in a surplus. Simply put, an oversupply is when there is more product for sale than people are prepared to buy. There are many reasons why oversupply may occur. There can be an oversupply of a current product due to people waiting for an improved model in a series, such as smartphones from a particular maker. Oversupply can also occur in situations where the price of the good or service is too high and people are simply not prepared to buy it at that price. An oversupply may also simply be a case of a producer completely misreading the market demand for a product."
Overtrading,"Overtrading refers to the excessive buying and selling of stocks by either a broker or an individual trader. Both are entirely different situations and have very different implications. An individual trader, whether working for themselves or employed on a trading desk by a financial firm, will have rules about how much risk they can take, including how many trades are appropriate for them to make."
Overvalued,"An overvalued stock has a current price that is not justified by its earnings outlook, known as profit projections, or its price-earnings (P/E) ratio. Consequently, analysts and other economic experts expect the price to drop eventually."
Overweight,"An overweight investment is an asset or industry sector that comprises a higher-than-normal percentage of a portfolio or an index.

Paid-Up Capital,"Paid-up capital is the amount of money a company has received from shareholders in exchange for shares of stock. Paid-up capital is created when a company sells its shares on the primary market directly to investors, usually through an initial public offering (IPO).

Painting the Tape,"Painting the tape is a form of market manipulation whereby market players attempt to influence the price of a security by buying and selling it among themselves to create the appearance of substantial trading activity. The goal of painting the tape is to create the illusion of an increased interest in a stock to trick investors into buying shares, which would drive the price higher."

Parabolic SAR (Stop and Reverse) Indicator,"The parabolic SAR indicator, developed by J. Wells Wilder, is used by traders to determine trend direction and potential reversals in price. The indicator uses a trailing stop and reverse method called ""SAR,"" or stop and reverse, to identify suitable exit and entry points. Traders also refer to the indicator as the parabolic stop and reverse, parabolic SAR, or PSAR."
Paradox of Thrift,"The paradox of thrift, or paradox of savings, is an economic theory that posits that personal savings are a net drag on the economy during a recession.

Pareto Improvement,"Under the rubric of neoclassical economic theory, a Pareto improvement occurs when a change in allocation harms no one and helps at least one person, given an initial allocation of goods for a set of persons. The theory states that Pareto improvements can keep enhancing value to an economy until it achieves a Pareto optimum, where no more Pareto improvements can be made."
Pareto Principle,"The Pareto Principle, named after esteemed economist Vilfredo Pareto, specifies that 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes, asserting an unequal relationship between inputs and outputs. This principle serves as a general reminder that the relationship between inputs and outputs is not balanced. The Pareto Principle is also known as the Pareto Rule or the 80/20 Rule."

Percentage of Completion Method,"The percentage of completion method is an accounting method in which the revenues and expenses of long-term contracts are recognized as a percentage of the work completed during the period. This is in contrast to the completed contract method, which defers the reporting of income and expenses until a project is completed. The percentage-of-completion method of accounting is common for the construction industry, but companies in other sectors also use the method."
Perfect Competition,Pure or perfect competition is a theoretical market structure in which the following criteria are met:

Periodic Interest Rate,"A periodic interest rate is a rate that can be charged on a loan, or realized on an investment over a specific period of time. Lenders typically quote interest rates on an annual basis, but the interest compounds more frequently than annually in most cases. The periodic interest rate is the annual interest rate divided by the number of compounding periods."
Permanent Income Hypothesis,"The permanent income hypothesis is a theory of consumer spending stating that people will spend money at a level consistent with their expected long-term average income. The level of expected long-term income then becomes thought of as the level of “permanent” income that can be safely spent. A worker will save only if their current income is higher than the anticipated level of permanent income, in order to guard against future declines in income."
Permanent Life Insurance,"Permanent life insurance is an umbrella term for life insurance policies that do not expire. Typically, permanent life insurance combines a death benefit with a savings portion."
Perpetual Bond,"A perpetual bond, also known as a ""consol bond"" or ""prep,"" is a fixed income security with no maturity date.

However, the major benefit of them is that they pay a steady stream of interest payments forever."
Perpetual Inventory,"Perpetual inventory is a method of accounting for inventory that records the sale or purchase of inventory immediately through the use of computerized point-of-sale systems and enterprise asset management software. Perpetual inventory provides a highly detailed view of changes in inventory with immediate reporting of the amount of inventory in stock, and accurately reflects the level of goods on hand. Within this system, a company makes no effort at keeping detailed inventory records of products on hand; rather, purchases of goods are recorded as a debit to the inventory database. Effectively, the cost of goods sold includes such elements as direct labor and materials costs and direct factory overhead costs."
Perpetuity,"A perpetuity is a security that pays for an infinite amount of time. In finance, perpetuity is a constant stream of identical cash flows with no end. The formula to calculate the present value of a perpetuity, or security with perpetual cash flows, is as follows:"

As described by the acronym, those four areas are central to this model."
Peter Principle,"The Peter Principle is an observation that the tendency in most organizational hierarchies, such as that of a corporation, is for every employee to rise in the hierarchy through promotion until they reach a level of respective incompetence. In other words, a front-office secretary who is quite good at her job may thus be promoted to executive assistant to the CEO for which she is not trained or prepared for—meaning that she would be more productive for the company (and likely herself) if she had not been promoted."
Petrodollars,"Petrodollars are U.S. dollars paid to an oil-exporting country for the sale of the commodity. Put simply, the petrodollar system is an exchange of oil for U.S. dollars between countries that buy oil and those that produce it."

Wealthy individuals sometimes establish private foundations to facilitate their philanthropic efforts.
Phillips Curve,"The Phillips curve is an economic concept developed by A. W. Phillips stating that inflation and unemployment have a stable and inverse relationship. The theory claims that with economic growth comes inflation, which in turn should lead to more jobs and less unemployment. However, the original concept has been somewhat disproven empirically due to the occurrence of stagflation in the 1970s, when there were high levels of both inflation and unemployment.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿"
Physical Capital,"Physical capital is one of what economists call the three main factors of production. It consists of tangible, man-made goods that assist in the process of creating a product or service.

Pigovian Tax,"A Pigovian (Pigouvian) tax is a tax assessed against private individuals or businesses for engaging in activities that create adverse side effects for society. Adverse side effects are those costs that are not included as a part of the product's market price. These include environmental pollution, strains on public healthcare from the sale of tobacco products, and any other side effects that have an external, negative impact. Pigovian taxes were named after English economist, Arthur Pigou, a significant contributor to early externality theory."
PIIGS,"PIIGS is an offensive acronym for Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain, which were the weakest economies in the eurozone during the European debt crisis. At the time, the acronym's five countries garnered attention due to their weakened economic output and financial instability, which heightened doubts about the nation's abilities to pay back bondholders and spurred fears that these nations would default on their debts."
PIMCO (Pacific Investment Management Co.),"PIMCO, or the Pacific Investment Management Company, is an American investment management firm founded in 1971 in California. The firm focuses on fixed income and manages more than $1.92 trillion in assets. The firm primarily handles portfolio management, account management, and business management."

Many pink sheet listings are for stocks in companies that cannot meet the requirements for listing on a major U.S. stock exchange like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Some companies choose to sell their shares through the over-the-counter network to avoid the greater costs and regulatory requirements for listing on an exchange.
Piotroski Score,"The Piotroski Score is a discrete score between zero and nine that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a firm's financial position. The Piotroski Score is used to determine the best value stocks, with nine being the best and zero being the worst."
Pip,"Pip is an acronym for ""percentage in point"" or ""price interest point."" A pip is the smallest price move that an exchange rate can make based on forex market convention. Most currency pairs are priced out to four decimal places and the pip change is the last (fourth) decimal point. A pip is thus equivalent to 1/100 of 1% or one basis point.﻿﻿"
Pitchbook,"A pitchbook is a sales document created by an investment bank or firm that details the main attributes of the firm, which is then used by the firm's sales force to help sell products and services and generate new clients.

Platykurtic,"The term ""platykurtic"" refers to a statistical distribution in which the excess kurtosis value is negative. For this reason, a platykurtic distribution will have thinner tails than a normal distribution will, resulting in fewer extreme positive or negative events. The opposite of a platykurtic distribution is a leptokurtic distribution, in which excess kurtosis is positive."
Pledged Asset,"A pledged asset is a valuable possession that is transferred to a lender to secure a debt or loan.

Poisson Distribution,"In statistics, a Poisson distribution is a probability distribution that can be used to show how many times an event is likely to occur within a specified period of time﻿. In other words, it is a count distribution. Poisson distributions are often used to understand independent events that occur at a constant rate within a given interval of time. It was named after French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson."
Political Action Committee (Super PAC),"In the U.S., a political action committee (PAC) is a political committee that pools campaign contributions from members and donates those funds to campaigns for or against candidates, ballot initiatives, or legislation.

Political Economy,"Political economy is an interdisciplinary branch of the social sciences that focuses on the interrelationships among individuals, governments, and public policy."
Political Risk,"Political risk is the risk an investment's returns could suffer as a result of political changes or instability in a country. Instability affecting investment returns could stem from a change in government, legislative bodies, other foreign policymakers or military control. Political risk is also known as ""geopolitical risk,"" and becomes more of a factor as the time horizon of investment gets longer. They are considered a type of jurisdiction risk."
Ponzi Scheme,A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investing scam promising high rates of return with little risk to investors. A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investing scam which generates returns for earlier investors with money taken from later investors. This is similar to a pyramid scheme in that both are based on using new investors' funds to pay the earlier backers.
Pooled Funds,"Pooled funds are funds in a portfolio from many individual investors that are aggregated for the purposes of investment. Mutual funds, hedge funds, exchange traded funds, pension funds, and unit investment trusts are all examples of professionally managed pooled funds. Investors in pooled funds benefit from economies of scale, which allow for lower trading costs per dollar of investment, and diversification."
Population Statistics,"A population is a distinct group of individuals, whether that group comprises a nation or a group of people with a common characteristic. In statistics, a population is the pool of individuals from which a statistical sample is drawn for a study. Thus, any selection of individuals grouped together by a common feature can be said to be a population."
Pork Barrel Politics,"Pork-barrel politics is the legislator's practice of slipping funding for a local project into a budget. The project may have nothing to do with the bill and may benefit only the legislator's home district. Before a bill gets to a vote, pork-barreling has often greatly inflated its costs through the addition of various legislators' pet projects."
Porter Diamond,"The Porter Diamond, properly referred to as the Porter Diamond Theory of National Advantage, is a model that is designed to help understand the competitive advantage that nations or groups possess due to certain factors available to them, and to explain how governments can act as catalysts to improve a country's position in a globally competitive economic environment. The model was created by Michael Porter, a recognized authority on corporate strategy and economic competition, and founder of the Institute for Strategy and Competitiveness at the Harvard Business School. It is a proactive economic theory, rather than one that simply quantifies competitive advantages that a country or region may have. The Porter Diamond is also referred to as ""Porter's Diamond"" or the ""Diamond Model."""
Porter's 5 Forces,"Porter's Five Forces is a model that identifies and analyzes five competitive forces that shape every industry and helps determine an industry's weaknesses and strengths. Five Forces analysis is frequently used to identify an industry's structure to determine corporate strategy. Porter's model can be applied to any segment of the economy to understand the level of competition within the industry and enhance a company's long-term profitability. The Five Forces model is named after Harvard Business School professor, Michael E. Porter."
Portfolio Investment,"A portfolio investment is ownership of a stock, bond, or other financial asset with the expectation that it will earn a return or grow in value over time, or both.

Portfolio of Financial Assets,"A portfolio is a collection of financial investments like stocks, bonds, commodities, cash, and cash equivalents, including closed-end funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs). People generally believe that stocks, bonds, and cash comprise the core of a portfolio. Though this is often the case, it does not need to be the rule. A portfolio may contain a wide range of assets including real estate, art, and private investments."
Portfolio Runoff,"Portfolio runoff is a general concept in portfolio management that describes situations where assets decrease. Runoff can occur for a variety of reasons including the maturation or expiration of securities, liquidation of certain assets, or any other situation where assets decrease or are withdrawn from a portfolio."
Portfolio Turnover,"Portfolio turnover is a measure of how frequently assets within a fund are bought and sold by the managers. Portfolio turnover is calculated by taking either the total amount of new securities purchased or the number of securities sold (whichever is less) over a particular period, divided by the total net asset value (NAV) of the fund. The measurement is usually reported for a 12-month time period."
Portfolio Variance,"Portfolio variance is a measurement of risk, of how the aggregate actual returns of a set of securities making up a portfolio fluctuate over time. This portfolio variance statistic is calculated using the standard deviations of each security in the portfolio as well as the correlations of each security pair in the portfolio."
Position Trader,A position trader buys an investment for the long term in the expectation that it will appreciate in value. This type of trader is less concerned with short-term fluctuations in price and the news of the day unless they alter the trader's long term view of the position.
Positive Correlation,"Positive correlation is a relationship between two variables in which both variables move in tandem—that is, in the same direction. A positive correlation exists when one variable decreases as the other variable decreases, or one variable increases while the other increases."
Positive Economics,"The term positive economics refers to the objective analysis in the study of economics. Most economists look at what has happened and what is currently happening in a given economy to form their basis of predictions for the future. This investigative process is positive economics. Conversely, a normative economic study bases future predictions on value judgments."
Positive Pay,"Positive pay is an automated cash-management service used by financial institutions employed to deter check fraud. Banks use positive pay to match the checks a company issues with those it presents for payment. Any check considered suspect is sent back to the issuer for examination.

There is generally a charge incurred for using it, although some banks now offer the service for a reduced fee or free."
Post-Money Valuation,Post-money valuation is a company's estimated worth after outside financing and/or capital injections are added to its balance sheet. Post-money valuation refers to the approximate market value given to a start-up after a round of financing from venture capitalists or angel investors have been completed. Valuations that are calculated before these funds are added are called pre-money valuations. The post-money valuation is equal to the pre-money valuation plus the amount of any new equity received from outside investors.
Post-Trade Processing,"Post-trade processing occurs after a trade is complete. At this point, the buyer and the seller compare trade details, approve the transaction, change records of ownership, and arrange for the transfer of securities and cash. Post-trade processing is especially important in markets that are not standardized, such as the over-the-counter (OTC) markets."
Posterior Probability,"A posterior probability, in Bayesian statistics, is the revised or updated probability of an event occurring after taking into consideration new information. The posterior probability is calculated by updating the prior probability using Bayes' theorem. In statistical terms, the posterior probability is the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred."
Poverty Trap,"A poverty trap is a mechanism that makes it very difficult for people to escape poverty. A poverty trap is created when an economic system requires a significant amount of capital in order to earn enough to escape poverty. When individuals lack this capital, they may also find it difficult to acquire it, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of poverty."
Power Distance Index (PDI),"The power-distance index (PDI) is a measurement of the acceptance of a hierarchy of power and wealth by the individuals who make up the general population of a nation, culture, or business. Developed by Dutch social psychologist Geert Hofstede, the PDI ultimately provides insight into the extent to which regular citizens, or subordinates, accept or challenge the authority of the person or people in charge."

Pre-Foreclosure,"Pre-foreclosure refers to the beginning phase of a legal proceeding that ultimately can conclude in property being repossessed from a defaulted borrower. In pre-foreclosure, the lender files a notice of default on the property because the borrowing owner has exceeded the contractual terms for delinquent payments. A notice of default informs the borrowing owner that the lender is pursuing legal actions toward foreclosure."
Pre-IPO,"A pre-initial public offering (IPO) placement is a private sale of large blocks of shares before a stock is listed on a public exchange. The buyers are typically private equity firms, hedge funds, and other institutions willing to buy large stakes in the firm. Due to the size of the investments being made and the risks involved, the buyers in a pre-IPO placement usually get a discount from the price stated in the prospective for the IPO."
Pre-Market,The pre-market is the period of trading activity that occurs before the regular market session. The pre-market trading session typically occurs between 8:00 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. EST each trading day. Many investors and traders watch the pre-market trading activity to judge the strength and direction of the market in anticipation for the regular trading session.
Predatory Pricing,"Predatory pricing is the illegal act of setting prices low in an attempt to eliminate the competition. Predatory pricing violates antitrust law, as it makes markets more vulnerable to a monopoly."
Preemptive Rights,Preemptive rights give a shareholder the opportunity to buy additional shares in any future issue of a company's common stock before the shares are made available to the general public. This right is a contractual clause that is generally available in the U.S. only to early investors in a newly public company or to majority owners who want to protect their stake in the company when and if additional shares are issued.

Preferred stockholders have a higher claim to dividends or asset distribution than common stockholders.﻿﻿ The details of each preferred stock depend on the issue."
Premium Bond,A premium bond is a bond trading above its face value or in other words; it costs more than the face amount on the bond. A bond might trade at a premium because its interest rate is higher than current rates in the market.
Prepaid Expense,"A prepaid expense is a type of asset on the balance sheet that results from a business making advanced payments for goods or services to be received in the future. Prepaid expenses are initially recorded as assets, but their value is expensed over time onto the income statement. Unlike conventional expenses, the business will receive something of value from the prepaid expense over the course of several accounting periods."

Prepayment Penalty,"A prepayment penalty is usually specified in a clause in a mortgage contract stating that a penalty will be assessed if the borrower significantly pays down or pays off the mortgage before term, usually within the first three years of committing to the loan. The penalty is sometimes based on a percentage of the remaining mortgage balance, or it can be a certain number of months’ worth of interest. Prepayment penalties protect the lender against the financial loss of interest income that would otherwise have been paid over time."
Prepayment Risk,"Prepayment risk is the risk involved with the premature return of principal on a fixed-income security. When debtors return part of the principal early, they do not have to make interest payments on that part of the principal. That means investors in associated fixed-income securities will not receive interest paid on the principal. The prepayment risk is highest for fixed-income securities, such as callable bonds and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Bonds with prepayment risk often have prepayment penalties."
Present Value,"Present value (PV) is the current value of a future sum of money or stream of cash flows given a specified rate of return. Future cash flows are discounted at the discount rate, and the higher the discount rate, the lower the present value of the future cash flows. Determining the appropriate discount rate is the key to properly valuing future cash flows, whether they be earnings or debt obligations."
Present Value Interest Factor (PVIF),The present value interest factor (PVIF) is a formula used to estimate the current worth of a sum of money that is to be received at some future date. PVIFs are often presented in the form of a table with values for different time periods and interest rate combinations.
Present Value Interest Factor of Annuity (PVIFA),"The present value interest factor of an annuity is a factor that can be used to calculate the present value of a series of annuities when it is multiplied by the recurring payment amount. The initial deposit earns interest at the interest rate (r), which perfectly finances a series of (n) consecutive withdrawals and may be written as the following formula:"
Present Value of an Annuity,"The present value of an annuity is the current value of future payments from an annuity, given a specified rate of return, or discount rate. The higher the discount rate, the lower the present value of the annuity."
Preservation of Capital,"Preservation of capital is a conservative investment strategy where the primary goal is to preserve capital and prevent loss in a portfolio. This strategy necessitates investment in the safest short-term instruments, such as Treasury bills and certificates of deposit."
Press Conference,A press conference is an event organized to officially distribute information and answer questions from the media. Press conferences are also announced in response to specific public relations issues.
Pretax Earnings,"Pretax earnings is a company's income after all operating expenses, including interest and depreciation, have been deducted from total sales or revenues, but before income taxes have been subtracted. Because pretax earnings exclude taxes, this measure enables the intrinsic profitability of companies to be compared across industries or geographic regions where corporate taxes differ. For instance, while U.S.-based corporations face the same tax rates at the federal level, they face different tax rates at the state level."
Pretax Profit Margin,"The pretax profit margin is a financial accounting tool used to measure the operating efficiency of a company. It is a ratio that tells us the percentage of sales that has turned into profits or, in other words, how many cents of profit the business has generated for each dollar of sale before deducting taxes. The pretax profit margin is widely used to compare the profitability of businesses within the same industry."
Price Action,"Price action is the movement of a security's price plotted over time. Price action forms the basis for all technical analysis of a stock, commodity or other asset chart. Many short-term traders rely exclusively on price action and the formations and trends extrapolated from it to make trading decisions. Technical analysis as a practice is a derivative of price action since it uses past prices in calculations that can then be used to inform trading decisions."
Price Ceiling,"A price ceiling is the mandated maximum amount a seller is allowed to charge for a product or service. Usually set by law, price ceilings are typically applied to staples such as food and energy products when such goods become unaffordable to regular consumers."
Price Controls,"The term ""price controls"" refers to the legal minimum or maximum prices set for specified goods. Price controls are normally mandated by the government in the free market. They are usually implemented as a means of direct economic intervention to manage the affordability of certain goods and services, including rent, gasoline, and food. Although it may make certain goods and services more affordable, price controls can often lead to disruptions in the market, losses for producers, and a noticeable change in quality."
Price Discovery,"Price discovery is the overall process, whether explicit or inferred, of setting the spot price or the proper price of an asset, security, commodity, or currency. The process of price discovery looks at a number of tangible and intangible factors, including supply and demand, investor risk attitudes, and the overall economic and geopolitical environment. Simply put, it is where a buyer and a seller agree on a price and a transaction occurs."
Price Discrimination,"Price discrimination is a selling strategy that charges customers different prices for the same product or service based on what the seller thinks they can get the customer to agree to. In pure price discrimination, the seller charges each customer the maximum price they will pay. In more common forms of price discrimination, the seller places customers in groups based on certain attributes and charges each group a different price."
Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) Ratio,"The price/earnings to growth ratio (PEG ratio) is a stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divided by the growth rate of its earnings for a specified time period. The PEG ratio is used to determine a stock's value while also factoring in the company's expected earnings growth, and it is thought to provide a more complete picture than the more standard P/E ratio."

Price Level,"Price level is the average of current prices across the entire spectrum of goods and services produced in an economy. In more general terms, price level refers to the price or cost of a good, service, or security in the economy."
Price Rate of Change Indicator (ROC),"The Price Rate of Change (ROC) is a momentum-based technical indicator that measures the percentage change in price between the current price and the price a certain number of periods ago. The ROC indicator is plotted against zero, with the indicator moving upwards into positive territory if price changes are to the upside, and moving into negative territory if price changes are to the downside."
Price Sensitivity,"Price sensitivity is the degree to which the price of a product affects consumers' purchasing behaviors. Generally speaking, it's how demand changes with the change in the cost of products."
Price Skimming,"Price skimming is a product pricing strategy by which a firm charges the highest initial price that customers will pay and then lowers it over time. As the demand of the first customers is satisfied and competition enters the market, the firm lowers the price to attract another, more price-sensitive segment of the population. The skimming strategy gets its name from ""skimming"" successive layers of cream, or customer segments, as prices are lowered over time."
Price Stickiness,"Price stickiness, or sticky prices, is the resistance of market price(s) to change quickly, despite shifts in the broad economy suggesting a different price is optimal. ""Sticky"" is a general economics term that can apply to any financial variable that is resistant to change. When applied to prices, it means that the sellers (or buyers) of certain goods are reluctant to change the price, despite changes in input cost or demand patterns."
Price-Taker,"A price-taker is an individual or company that must accept prevailing prices in a market, lacking the market share to influence market price on its own. All economic participants are considered to be price-takers in a market of perfect competition or one in which all companies sell an identical product, there are no barriers to entry or exit, every company has a relatively small market share, and all buyers have full information of the market. This holds true for producers and consumers of goods and services and for buyers and sellers in debt and equity markets."
Price Target,"A price target is an analyst's projection of a security's future price. Price targets can pertain to all types of securities, from complex investment products to stocks and bonds. When setting a stock's price target, an analyst is trying to determine what the stock is worth and where the price will be in 12 or 18 months. Ultimately, price targets depend on the valuation of the company that's issuing the stock."
Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B Ratio),"Companies use the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) to compare a firm's market capitalization to its book value. It's calculated by dividing the company's stock price per share by its book value per share (BVPS). An asset's book value is equal to its carrying value on the balance sheet, and companies calculate it netting the asset against its accumulated depreciation."
Price-to-Cash Flow Ratio,"The price-to-cash flow (P/CF) ratio is a stock valuation indicator or multiple that measures the value of a stock’s price relative to its operating cash flow per share.

Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio),The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) is the ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its per-share earnings (EPS). The price-to-earnings ratio is also sometimes known as the price multiple or the earnings multiple.
Price to Free Cash Flow,"Price to free cash flow is an equity valuation metric used to compare a company's per-share market price to its per-share amount of free cash flow (FCF). This metric is very similar to the valuation metric of price to cash flow but is considered a more exact measure, owing to the fact that it uses free cash flow, which subtracts capital expenditures (CAPEX) from a company's total operating cash flow, thereby reflecting the actual cash flow available to fund non-asset-related growth. Companies use this metric when they need to expand their asset bases either in order to grow their businesses or simply to maintain acceptable levels of free cash flow."
Price-to-Rent Ratio,"The price-to-rent ratio is the ratio of home prices to annualized rent in a given location. This ratio is used as a benchmark for estimating whether it's cheaper to rent or own property. The price-to-rent ratio is used as an indicator for whether housing markets are fairly valued, or in a bubble."
Price-to-Sales (P/S),The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is a valuation ratio that compares a company’s stock price to its revenues. It is an indicator of the value that financial markets have placed on each dollar of a company’s sales or revenues.
Price to Tangible Book Value (PTBV),"The price to tangible book value (PTBV) is a valuation ratio expressing the price of a security compared to its hard, or tangible, book value as reported in the company's balance sheet. The tangible book value number is equal to the company's total book value less than the value of any intangible assets. Intangible assets can be such items as patents, intellectual property, goodwill, etc. The ratio is calculated as:"
Price Value of a Basis Point (PVBP),Price value of a basis point (PVBP) is a measure used to describe how a basis point change in yield affects the price of a bond.
Price-Weighted Index,"A price-weighted index is a stock index in which each company included in the index makes up a fraction of the total index proportional to that company's share stock price per share. In its simplest form, adding the price of each stock in the index and dividing by the total number of companies determines the index's value."
Prima Facie,"Prima facie is a legal claim that has sufficient evidence to proceed to trial or judgment. In Latin, prima facie means “at first sight” or “at first view."""

In general, the shares of these businesses are less liquid, and their valuations are more difficult to determine."
Private Equity,"Private equity is an alternative investment class and consists of capital that is not listed on a public exchange. Private equity is composed of funds and investors that directly invest in private companies, or that engage in buyouts of public companies, resulting in the delisting of public equity.

In other words, a good is considered to be a private good if there is competition between individuals to obtain the good and if consuming the good prevents someone else from consuming it."
Private Investment Fund,"A private investment fund is an investment company that does not solicit capital from retail investors or the general public. Members of a private investment company typically have deep knowledge of the industry as well as investments elsewhere. To be classified as a private fund, a fund must meet one of the exemptions outlined in the Investment Company Act of 1940. The 3C1 or 3C7 exemptions within the Act are frequently used to establish a fund as a private investment fund. There is an advantage to maintaining private investment fund status, as the regulatory and legal requirements are much lower than what is required for funds that are traded publicly."
Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE),"Private investment in public equity (PIPE) is the buying of shares of publicly traded stock at a price below the current market value (CMV) per share. This buying method is a practice of investment firms, mutual funds, and other large, accredited investors.

Probability Density Function (PDF),"Probability density function (PDF) is a statistical expression that defines a probability distribution (the likelihood of an outcome) for a discrete random variable (e.g., a stock or ETF) as opposed to a continuous random variable."
Probability Distribution,"A probability distribution is a statistical function that describes all the possible values and likelihoods that a random variable can take within a given range. This range will be bounded between the minimum and maximum possible values, but precisely where the possible value is likely to be plotted on the probability distribution depends on a number of factors. These factors include the distribution's mean (average), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis."

Quid Pro Quo Contribution,A quid pro quo contribution is a charitable donation for which the donor receives something from the recipient in exchange for their funds.﻿﻿
Quiet Period,"Prior to a company’s Initial Public Offering (IPO), the quiet period is an SEC-mandated embargo on promotional publicity. This prohibits management teams or their marketing agents from making forecasts or expressing any opinions about the value of their company."
Quiet Title,"Quiet title is a lawsuit filed to establish ownership of real estate when ownership is in question. Real estate owners want to ensure that they have a clear title, meaning that there are no liens or levies against the title and no disputes over the property's ownership. These possible problems are known as clouds on the title and can be resolved by action to quiet the title. When you quiet the title, you are insuring that once and for all, there is only one clear owner of the title."
Quiet Title Action,"A quiet title action, also known as an action of quiet title, is a circuit court action—or lawsuit—that is filed with the intended purpose to establish or settle the title to a property. Quiet title actions are particularly prevalent in cases where there is a disagreement on the title and the lawsuit is meant to remove, or “quiet,” a claim or objection to a title."
Quintiles,"A quintile is a statistical value of a data set that represents 20% of a given population, so the first quintile represents the lowest fifth of the data (1% to 20%); the second quintile represents the second fifth (21% to 40%) and so on."
Quitclaim Deed,"A quitclaim deed releases a person's interest in a property without stating the nature of the person's interest or rights, and with no warranties of that person’s interest or rights in the property. A quitclaim deed neither states nor guarantees that the person relinquishing their claim to the property had valid ownership, but it does prevent that person (the grantor) from later claiming they have an interest in the property."
Quorums,A quorum refers to the minimum acceptable level of individuals with a vested interest in a company needed to make the proceedings of a meeting valid under the corporate charter. This clause or general agreement ensures there is sufficient representation present at meetings before any changes can be made by the board.
Quota Share Treaty,"A quota share treaty is a pro-rata reinsurance contract in which the insurer and reinsurer share premiums and losses according to a fixed percentage. Quota share reinsurance allows an insurer to retain some risk and premium while sharing the rest with an insurer up to a predetermined maximum coverage. Overall, it's a way for an insurer to boost and preserve some of its capital."
Quotation,"Quotations refer to the most recent sale price of a stock, bond, or any other asset traded. In addition, most asset classes also quote the bid and ask price that determines the final sale price. The bid is defined as the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for the assets, while the ask is the highest price a seller is willing to receive for selling."
Quote,A quote is the last price at which an asset traded; it is the most recent price that a buyer and seller agreed upon and at which some amount of the asset was transacted.
Quote Currency,"In foreign exchange (forex), the quote currency, commonly known as the counter currency, is the second currency in both a direct and indirect currency pair and is used to determine the value of the base currency."
Quote-Driven Market,"A quote-driven market is an electronic stock exchange system in which prices are determined from bid and ask quotations made by market makers, dealers, or specialists. In a quote-driven market, also known as a price-driven market, dealers fill orders from their own inventory or by matching them with other orders. A quote-driven market is the opposite of an order-driven market, which displays individual investors' bid and ask prices and the number of shares they want to trade."
Quote Stuffing,"Quote stuffing is the practice of quickly entering and then withdrawing large orders in an attempt to flood the market with quotes, causing competitors to lose time in processing them."
Quoted Price,"A quoted price is the most recent price at which an investment (or any other type of asset) has traded. The quoted price of investments such as stocks, bonds, commodities, and derivatives changes constantly throughout the day as events occur that affect the financial markets and the perceived value of various investments. The quoted price represents the most recent bid and ask prices that buyers and sellers were able to agree on."
R-Squared,"R-squared (R2) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model. Whereas correlation explains the strength of the relationship between an independent and dependent variable, R-squared explains to what extent the variance of one variable explains the variance of the second variable. So, if the R2 of a model is 0.50, then approximately half of the observed variation can be explained by the model's inputs."
Rabbi Trust,"A rabbi trust is a trust created to support the non-qualified benefit obligations of employers to their employees. A rabbi and his congregation first used this type of trust after an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) private letter ruling approved its use; it has been referred to as a rabbi trust ever since. In essence, it is a non-qualified employee trust created for the benefit of both the employer and employee."
Race to the Bottom,"The race to the bottom refers to a competitive situation where a company, state, or nation attempts to undercut the competition's prices by sacrificing quality standards or worker safety (often defying regulation), or reducing labor costs. A race to the bottom can also occur among regions. For example, a jurisdiction may relax regulations or cut taxes and compromise the public good in an attempt to attract investment, such as the building of a new factory or corporate office."
Racketeering,"The term racketeering broadly refers to criminal acts, typically those involving extortion. It is usually used in reference to patterns of illegal activity specified in the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). This is a U.S. federal law that makes it illegal to acquire or control a business through certain crimes or income from those crimes. It is also illegal to participate, even indirectly, in certain crimes committed by a business or to conspire to do any of the above under the act."
Rally,"A rally is a period of sustained increases in the prices of stocks, bonds, or related indexes. A rally usually involves rapid or substantial upside moves over a relatively short period of time. This type of price movement can happen during either a bull or a bear market, when it is known as either a bull market rally or a bear market rally, respectively. However, a rally will typically follow a period of flat or declining prices."
Ramp Up,"Ramp up is a significant increase in the level of output of a company's products or services. A ramp-up typically occurs in anticipation of an imminent increase in demand. While it is generally a feature of smaller companies at an early stage of development, a ramp up can also be undertaken by large companies that are rolling out new products or expanding in new geographies."
Random Variables,"A random variable is a variable whose value is unknown or a function that assigns values to each of an experiment's outcomes. Random variables are often designated by letters and can be classified as discrete, which are variables that have specific values, or continuous, which are variables that can have any values within a continuous range."
Random Walk Theory,"Random walk theory suggests that changes in stock prices have the same distribution and are independent of each other. Therefore, it assumes the past movement or trend of a stock price or market cannot be used to predict its future movement. In short, random walk theory proclaims that stocks take a random and unpredictable path that makes all methods of predicting stock prices futile in the long run."
Ratchet Effect,"The ratchet effect is an economic process that is difficult to reverse once it is underway or has already occurred. A ratchet is an analogy to a mechanical ratchet, which spins one way but not the other, in an economic process that tends to only work one way. The results or side effects of the process may reinforce the cause by creating or altering incentives and expectations among participants."
Rate-and-Term Refinance,"A rate-and-term refinance changes the interest rate, the term—or both the rate and the term—of an existing mortgage without advancing any new money. It is also known as a “no cash-out refinance.”"
Rate of Change (ROC),"The rate of change (ROC) is the speed at which a variable changes over a specific period of time. ROC is often used when speaking about momentum, and it can generally be expressed as a ratio between a change in one variable relative to a corresponding change in another; graphically, the rate of change is represented by the slope of a line. The ROC is often illustrated by the Greek letter delta."
Rate of Return,"A rate of return (RoR) is the net gain or loss of an investment over a specified time period, expressed as a percentage of the investment’s initial cost. When calculating the rate of return, you are determining the percentage change from the beginning of the period until the end."
Rating,"A rating is an assessment tool assigned by an analyst or rating agency to a stock or bond. The rating assigned indicates the stock or bond's level of investment opportunity. The three major rating agencies are Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investors Service, and Fitch Ratings."
Ratio Analysis,"Ratio analysis is a quantitative method of gaining insight into a company's liquidity, operational efficiency, and profitability by studying its financial statements such as the balance sheet and income statement. Ratio analysis is a cornerstone of fundamental equity analysis."
Rational Behavior,Rational behavior refers to a decision-making process that is based on making choices that result in the optimal level of benefit or utility for an individual. The assumption of rational behavior implies that people would rather take actions that benefit them versus actions that are neutral or harm them. Most classical economic theories are based on the assumption that all individuals taking part in an activity are behaving rationally.
Rational Choice Theory,"Rational choice theory states that individuals use rational calculations to make rational choices and achieve outcomes that are aligned with their own personal objectives. These results are also associated with maximizing an individual's self-interest. Using rational choice theory is expected to result in outcomes that provide people with the greatest benefit and satisfaction, given the limited option they have available."
Rational Expectations Theory,"The rational expectations theory is a concept and modeling technique that is used widely in macroeconomics. The theory posits that individuals base their decisions on three primary factors: their human rationality, the information available to them, and their past experiences."
Rationalization,"Rationalization is the reorganization of a company in order to increase its operating efficiency. This sort of reorganization may lead to an expansion or reduction in company size, a change of policy, or alteration of strategy pertaining to particular products offered. Similar to a reorganization, a rationalization is more widespread, encompassing strategy as well as structural changes. Rationalization is necessary for a company to increase revenue, decrease costs and improve its bottom line."
Rationing,"Rationing is the practice of controlling the distribution of a good or service in order to cope with scarcity. Rationing is a mandate of the government, at the local or federal level. It can be undertaken in response to adverse weather conditions, trade or import/export restrictions, or, in more extreme cases, during a recession or a war."
Raw Materials,Raw materials are materials or substances used in the primary production or manufacturing of goods. Raw materials are commodities that are bought and sold on commodities exchanges worldwide. Traders buy and sell raw materials in what is called the factor market because raw materials are factors of production as are labor and capital.
Reaganomics,"Reaganomics is a popular term referring to the economic policies of Ronald Reagan, the 40th U.S. president (1981–1989). His policies called for widespread tax cuts, decreased social spending, increased military spending, and the deregulation of domestic markets. These economic policies were introduced in response to a prolonged period of economic stagflation that began under President Gerald Ford in 1976."
Real Asset,"Real assets are physical assets that have an intrinsic worth due to their substance and properties. Real assets include precious metals, commodities, real estate, land, equipment, and natural resources. They are appropriate for inclusion in most diversified portfolios because of their relatively low correlation with financial assets, such as stocks and bonds."
Real Economic Growth Rate,"The real economic growth rate, or real GDP growth rate, measures economic growth, as expressed by gross domestic product (GDP), from one period to another, adjusted for inflation or deflation. In other words, it reveals changes in the value of all goods and services produced by an economy—the economic output of a country—while accounting for price fluctuations."
Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER),The real effective exchange rate (REER) is the weighted average of a country's currency in relation to an index or basket of other major currencies. The weights are determined by comparing the relative trade balance of a country's currency against that of each country in the index.
Real Estate,"Real estate is the land along with any permanent improvements attached to the land, whether natural or man-made—including water, trees, minerals, buildings, homes, fences, and bridges. Real estate is a form of real property. It differs from personal property, which are things not permanently attached to the land, such as vehicles, boats, jewelry, furniture, and farm equipment."
Real Estate Agent,"A real estate agent is a licensed professional who arranges real estate transactions, putting buyers and sellers together and acting as their representative in negotiations. Real estate agents usually are compensated completely by a commission—a percentage of the property’s purchase price—so their income depends on their ability to close a deal. In almost every state a real estate agent must work for or be affiliated with a real estate broker (an individual or a brokerage firm), who is more experienced and licensed to a higher degree.﻿﻿"
Real Estate Investment Group,"A real estate investment group (REIG) refers to a business that focuses the majority of its efforts and capital on investing in real estate. In search of profits, real estate investment groups may choose to buy, renovate, sell, or finance properties. Real estate investment groups commonly buy out a multi-unit property and sell units to investors while taking responsibility for the administration and maintenance of the property."
Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT),"A real estate investment trust (REIT) is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-generating real estate. Modeled after mutual funds, REITs pool the capital of numerous investors. This makes it possible for individual investors to earn dividends from real estate investments—without having to buy, manage, or finance any properties themselves."
Real Estate Limited Partnership (RELP),"A real estate limited partnership (RELP) is a group of investors who pool their money to invest in property purchasing, development, or leasing. It is one of several forms of real estate investment group (REIG). Under its limited partnership (LP) status, a RELP has a general partner who assumes full liability and one or more limited partners who are liable only up to the amount they contribute."
Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit (REMIC),The term real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC) refers to a special purpose vehicle (SPV) or debt instrument that pools mortgage loans together and issues mortgage-backed securities (MBS).
Real Estate Operating Company (REOC),"The term real estate operating company (REOC) refers to a company that engages in real estate investments and whose shares are traded on a public exchange. These publicly-traded companies own and actively invest in properties—generally commercial real estate. Unlike real estate investment trusts (REITs), REOCs reinvest the money they earn back into their business and are subject to higher corporate taxes than REITs."
Real Estate Owned (REO),"Real estate owned (REO) is property owned by a lender, such as a bank, that has not been successfully sold at a foreclosure auction. A lender—often a bank or quasi-governmental entity such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac—takes ownership of a foreclosed property when it fails to sell at the amount sought to cover the loan.﻿﻿"
Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA),"The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) was enacted by Congress in 1975 to provide homebuyers and sellers with complete settlement cost disclosures. RESPA was also introduced to eliminate abusive practices in the real estate settlement process, prohibit kickbacks, and limit the use of escrow accounts. RESPA is a federal statute now regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)."
Real Estate Short Sale,"A short sale in real estate is when a financially distressed homeowner sells their property for less than the amount due on the mortgage. The buyer of the property is a third party (not the bank), and all proceeds from the sale go to the lender. The lender either forgives the difference or gets a deficiency judgment against the borrower requiring them to pay the lender all or part of the difference between the sale price and the original value of the mortgage. In some states, this difference must legally be forgiven in a short sale."
Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP),"Real gross domestic product (Real GDP) is an inflation-adjusted measure that reflects the value of all goods and services produced by an economy in a given year (expressed in base-year prices) and is often referred to as constant-price GDP, inflation-corrected GDP, or constant dollar GDP."
Real Income,Real income is how much money an individual or entity makes after accounting for inflation and is sometimes called real wage when referring to an individual's income. Individuals often closely track their nominal vs. real income to have the best understanding of their purchasing power.
Real Interest Rate,A real interest rate is an interest rate that has been adjusted to remove the effects of inflation to reflect the real cost of funds to the borrower and the real yield to the lender or to an investor. The real interest rate reflects the rate of time-preference for current goods over future goods. The real interest rate of an investment is calculated as the difference between the nominal interest rate and the inflation rate:
Real Property,"Real property is the land, everything that is permanently attached to the land, and all of the rights of ownership, including the right to possess, sell, lease, and enjoy the land. Real property can be classified according to its general use as residential, commercial, agricultural, industrial, or special purpose. In order to understand if you have the right to sell your home, you need to know which rights you possess—or don't possess—in the property."
Real Rate of Return,"Real rate of return is the annual percentage of profit earned on an investment, adjusted for inflation. Therefore, the real rate of return accurately indicates the actual purchasing power of a given amount of money over time."
Real Time,"Real time is when a system relays information to a user at a speed that is near-instantaneous or has a short delay from when the event occurred. Online brokerages often provide a real-time data feed that displays stock quotes and their respective real-time changes, with a very insignificant lag time, so that clients can base their investing decisions on the most up-to-date information."
Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS),"The term real-time gross settlement (RTGS) refers to a funds transfer system that allows for the instantaneous transfer of money and/or securities. RTGS is the continuous process of settling payments on an individual order basis without netting debits with credits across the books of a central bank. Once completed, real-time gross settlement payments are final and irrevocable. In most countries, the systems are managed and run by their central banks."
Real-Time Quote (RTQ),"A real-time quote (RTQs) is the display of the actual price of a security at that very moment in time. Quotes are the price of a stock or security displayed on various websites and ticker tapes. In most cases, these figures are not real-time numbers of where the securities are trading but are delayed quotes. Delayed quotes, unlike real-time quotes, may lag the real trading market by between 15 and 20 minutes. Real-time quotes are instantaneous with no delay."
Realization Multiple,"The realization multiple is a private equity measurement that shows how much has been paid out to investors. The realization multiple measures the return that is realized from the investment. Private equity funds are unique in that they hold assets that are pulled together from all sorts of illiquid sources, including leveraged buyouts (LBO), start-ups and so on. The realization multiple is found by dividing the cumulative distributions from a fund, company or project by the paid-in capital."
Realized Gain,A realized gain results from selling an asset at a price higher than the original purchase price. It occurs when an asset is sold at a level that exceeds its book value cost.
Realized Loss,A realized loss is the loss that is recognized when assets are sold for a price lower than the original purchase price. Realized loss occurs when an asset that was purchased at a level referred to as cost or book value is then disbursed for a value below its book value.
Realized Yield,"Realized yield is the actual return earned during the holding period for an investment. It may include dividends, interest payments, and other cash distributions. The term ""realized yield"" can be applied to a bond sold before its maturity date or a dividend-paying security. Generally speaking, the realized yield on bonds includes the coupon payments received during the holding period, plus or minus the change in the value of the original investment, calculated on an annual basis."
Realtor,"A realtor is a real estate professional who is a member of the National Association of Realtors (NAR), a professional association.

Rebate,"A rebate, broadly, refers to a sum of money that is credited or returned to a customer in the context of a transaction. A rebate may offer cashback on the purchase of a consumer good or service, either as a flat-rate rebate, which is automatically subtracted from the purchase price, or conditional rebates, which are only valid under certain conditions, such as ""buy one, get one free."" Some conditional rebates require the purchaser to submit a form along with proof of payment to the company offering the cashback."
Recapitalization,"Recapitalization is the process of restructuring a company's debt and equity mixture, often to stabilize a company's capital structure. The process mainly involves the exchange of one form of financing for another, such as removing preferred shares from the company's capital structure and replacing them with bonds."
Receipt,"A receipt is a written acknowledgment that something of value has been transferred from one party to another. In addition to the receipts consumers typically receive from vendors and service providers, receipts are also issued in business-to-business dealings as well as stock market transactions. For example, the holder of a futures contract is generally given a delivery instrument, which acts as a receipt in that it can be exchanged for the underlying asset when the futures contract expires."
Receivable,"Receivables, also referred to as accounts receivable, are debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services that have been delivered or used but not yet paid for."
Receivables Turnover Ratio,"The receivables turnover ratio is an accounting measure used to quantify a company's effectiveness in collecting its accounts receivable, or the money owed by customers or clients. This ratio measures how well a company uses and manages the credit it extends to customers and how quickly that short-term debt is collected or is paid. A firm that is efficient at collecting on its payments due will have a higher accounts receivable turnover ratio."
Receivership,"A receivership is a court-appointed tool that can assist creditors to recover funds in default and can help troubled companies to avoid bankruptcy. In the first instance, having a receivership in place makes it easier for a lender to recover funds due to them when a borrower defaults on a loan."

However, reconciliation can also be used for personal purposes in addition to business purposes."
Record Date,"The record date, or date of record, is the cut-off date established by a company in order to determine which shareholders are eligible to receive a dividend or distribution. The determination of a record date is required to ascertain who exactly a company's shareholders are as of that date, since shareholders of an actively traded stock are continually changing. The shareholders of record as of the record date will be entitled to receive the dividend or distribution, declared by the company."
Recourse,"A recourse is a legal agreement that gives the lender the right to pledged collateral if the borrower is unable to satisfy the debt obligation. Recourse refers to the lender's legal right to collect. Recourse lending provides protection to lenders, as they are assured of having some repayment, either in cash or liquid assets. Companies that use recourse debt have a lower cost of capital, as there is less underlying risk in lending to that firm."
Recourse Loan,The term recourse loan refers to a type of loan that can help a lender recoup its investment if a borrower fails to pay and the value of the underlying asset is not enough to cover it. A recourse loan is a form of secured financing. It lets the lender go after the debtor's other assets that were not used as loan collateral or to take legal action in case of default in order to pay off the full debt.
Recurring Billing,Recurring billing happens when a merchant automatically charges a customer for goods or services on a prearranged schedule. Recurring billing requires the merchant to get the customer’s information and permission. The vendor will then automatically make recurring charges to the customer’s account with no further permissions needed.
Recurring Revenue,"Recurring revenue is the portion of a company's revenue that is expected to continue in the future. Unlike one-off sales, these revenues are predictable, stable and can be counted on to occur at regular intervals going forward with a relatively high degree of certainty."
Red Herring Filing,"A red herring is a preliminary prospectus filed by a company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), usually in connection with the company's initial public offering (IPO). A red herring prospectus contains most of the information pertaining to the company's operations and prospects but does not include key details of the security issue, such as its price and the number of shares offered."
Redemption,"Depending on the context, the term redemption has different uses in the finance and business world. In finance, redemption refers to the repayment of any fixed-income security at or before the asset's maturity date. Bonds are the most common type of fixed-income security, but others include certificates of deposit (CDs), Treasury notes (T-notes), and preferred shares."
Redlining,"Redlining is a discriminatory practice that puts services (financial and otherwise) out of reach for residents of certain areas based on race or ethnicity. It can be seen in the systematic denial of mortgages, insurance, loans, and other financial services based on location (and that area’s default history) rather than on an individual’s qualifications and creditworthiness. Notably, the policy of redlining is felt the most by residents of minority neighborhoods."
Reference Number,A reference number is a unique identifier assigned to any financial transaction including those made using a credit or debit card. The reference number is created technologically and designated for a single transaction. A reference number helps an institution identify transactions in records and electronic databases used to monitor transactions associated with a card. Reference numbers from each transaction on a customer’s account are usually included in a cardholder’s monthly statement.
Reference Rate,"A reference rate is an interest rate benchmark used to set other interest rates. Various types of transactions use different reference rate benchmarks, but the most common include the Fed Funds Rate, LIBOR, the prime rate, and the rate on benchmark U.S. Treasury securities."
Refinance,"A refinance, or ""refi"" for short, refers to the process of revising and replacing the terms of an existing credit agreement, usually as it relates to a loan or mortgage. When a business or an individual decides to refinance a credit obligation, they effectively seek to make favorable changes to their interest rate, payment schedule, and/or other terms outlined in their contract. If approved, the borrower gets a new contract that takes the place of the original agreement."
Reflexivity,"Reflexivity in economics is the theory that a feedback loop exists in which investors' perceptions affect economic fundamentals, which in turn changes investor perception. The theory of reflexivity has its roots in sociology, but in the world of economics and finance, its primary proponent is George Soros. Soros believes that reflexivity disproves much of mainstream economic theory and should become a major focus of economic research, and even makes grandiose claims that it ""gives rise to a new morality as well as a new epistemology."""
Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP),"A Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP), sponsored by the Canadian government, encourages investing in a child's future post-secondary education.

Regret Theory,"Regret theory states that people anticipate regret if they make the wrong choice, and they consider this anticipation when making decisions. Fear of regret can play a significant role in dissuading someone from taking action or motivating a person to take action. Regret theory can impact an investor's rational behavior, impairing their ability to make investment decisions that would benefit them as opposed to harming them."
Regtech,"Regtech is the management of regulatory processes within the financial industry through technology. The main functions of regtech include regulatory monitoring, reporting, and compliance."
Regulated Investment Company (RIC) Pass Taxes on to Investors,"A regulated investment company (RIC) can be any one of several investment entities. For example, it may take the form of a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF), a real estate investment trust (REIT), or a unit investment trust (UIT). Whichever form the RIC assumes, the structure must be deemed eligible by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to pass through taxes for capital gains, dividends, or interest earned to the individual investors."
Regulation A,"Regulation A is an exemption from registration requirements—instituted by the Securities Act—that applies to public offerings of securities that do not exceed $50 million in any one-year period. Companies utilizing the Regulation A exemption must still file offering statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The result is that an agency, charged with acting in the public interest, instead acts in ways that benefit incumbent firms in the industry it is supposed to be regulating."
Regulatory Risk,"Regulatory risk is the risk that a change in laws and regulations will materially impact a security, business, sector, or market. A change in laws or regulations made by the government or a regulatory body can increase the costs of operating a business, reduce the attractiveness of an investment, or change the competitive landscape."
Rehypothecation,"Rehypothecation is a practice whereby banks and brokers use, for their own purposes, assets that have been posted as collateral by their clients. Clients who permit rehypothecation of their collateral may be compensated either through a lower cost of borrowing or a rebate on fees. In a typical example of rehypothecation, securities that have been posted with a prime brokerage as collateral by a hedge fund are used by the brokerage to back its own transactions and trades."
Reimbursement,"Reimbursement is compensation paid by an organization for out-of-pocket expenses incurred or overpayment made by an employee, customer, or another party. Reimbursement of business expenses, insurance costs, and overpaid taxes are common examples. However, unlike typical compensation, reimbursement is not subject to taxation."
Reinsurance,Reinsurance is also known as insurance for insurers or stop-loss insurance. Reinsurance is the practice whereby insurers transfer portions of their risk portfolios to other parties by some form of agreement to reduce the likelihood of paying a large obligation resulting from an insurance claim.
Reinsurance Ceded,"Reinsurance ceded refers to the portion of risk that a primary insurer passes to a reinsurer. It allows the primary insurer to reduce its risk exposure to an insurance policy it has underwritten by passing that risk to another company. Primary insurers are also also referred to as the ceding company while the reinsurance company is also called the accepting company. In exchange for taking on the risk, the reinsurance company receives a premium, and pays the claim for the risk it accepts."
Reinvestment,"Reinvestment is the practice of using dividends, interest, or any other form of income distribution earned in an investment to purchase additional shares or units, rather than receiving the distributions in cash."
Reinvestment Rate,"The reinvestment rate is the amount of interest that can be earned when money is taken out of one fixed-income investment and put into another. For example, the reinvestment rate is the amount of interest the investor could earn if he purchased a new bond while holding a callable bond called due because of an interest rate decline."
Reinvestment Risk,"Reinvestment risk refers to the possibility that an investor will be unable to reinvest cash flows received from an investment, such as coupon payments or interest, at a rate comparable to their current rate of return. This new rate is called the reinvestment rate."
Related-Party Transactions,"The term related-party transaction refers to a deal or arrangement made between two parties who are joined by a preexisting business relationship or common interest. Companies often seek business deals with parties with whom they are familiar or have a common interest. Although related-party transactions are themselves legal, they may create conflicts of interest or lead to other illegal situations. Public companies must disclose these transactions."
Relationship Management,"Relationship management is a strategy in which an organization maintains an ongoing level of engagement with its audience. This management can occur between a business and its customers (business to consumer [B2C]) or between a business and other businesses (business to business [B2B]). Relationship management aims to create a partnership between an organization and its patrons, instead of viewing the relationship as merely transactional."
Relationship Manager,Relationship managers work to improve business relationships with partner firms and clients. Relationship management is generally divided into two fields: client relationship management and business relationship management. Both fields share the common goal of facilitating good relationships so businesses can maximize the value of those relationships and maintain a good reputation.
Relative Strength,"Relative strength is a strategy used in momentum investing and in identifying value stocks. It focuses on investing in stocks or other investments that have performed well relative to the market as a whole or to a relevant benchmark. For example, a relative strength investor might select technology companies that have outperformed the Nasdaq Composite Index, or stocks that are outperforming the S&P 500 index."
Relative Strength Index (RSI),"The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100. The indicator was originally developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his seminal 1978 book, “New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems.”"
Relative Valuation Model,"A relative valuation model is a business valuation method that compares a company's value to that of its competitors or industry peers to assess the firm's financial worth. Relative valuation models are an alternative to absolute value models, which try to determine a company's intrinsic worth based on its estimated future free cash flows discounted to their present value, without any reference to another company or industry average. Like absolute value models, investors may use relative valuation models when determining whether a company's stock is a good buy."
Relative Value,"Relative value is a method of determining an asset's worth that takes into account the value of similar assets. This is in contrast with absolute value, which looks only at an asset's intrinsic value and does not compare it to other assets. The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) is a popular valuation method that can be used to measure the relative value of stocks."
Relative Vigor Index (RVI),The Relative Vigor Index (RVI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the strength of a trend by comparing a security's closing price to its trading range while smoothing the results using a simple moving average (SMA).
Relevant Cost,"Relevant cost is a managerial accounting term that describes avoidable costs that are incurred only when making specific business decisions. The concept of relevant cost is used to eliminate unnecessary data that could complicate the decision-making process. As an example, relevant cost is used to determine whether to sell or keep a business unit."
Relief Rally,A relief rally is a respite from a market sell-off that results in higher securities prices. Relief rallies often occur when anticipated negative news winds up being positive or less severe than expected.
Remittance,"A remittance is a payment of money that is transferred to another party. Broadly speaking, any payment of an invoice or a bill can be called a remittance. However, the term is most often used nowadays to describe a sum of money sent by someone working abroad to his or her family back home."
Remuneration,"Remuneration is the total compensation received by an employee. It includes not only base salary but any bonuses, commission payments, overtime pay, or other financial benefits that an employee receives from an employer."
Renewable Energy Certificate (REC),"Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) are a market-based instrument that certifies the bearer owns one megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity generated from a renewable energy resource. Once the power provider has fed the energy into the grid, the REC received can then be sold on the open market as an energy commodity. RECs earned may be sold, for example, to other entities that are polluting as a carbon credit to offset their emissions."
Renewable Resource,A renewable resource is one that can be used repeatedly and does not run out because it is naturally replaced.
Renko Chart,"A Renko chart is a type of chart, developed by the Japanese, that is built using price movement rather than both price and standardized time intervals like most charts are. It is thought to be named after the Japanese word for bricks, ""renga,"" since the chart looks like a series of bricks. A new brick is created when the price moves a specified price amount, and each block is positioned at a 45-degree angle (up or down) to the prior brick. An up brick is typically colored white or green, while a down brick is typically colored black or red."
Rent Control,"Rent control is a government program that places a limit on the amount that a landlord can demand for leasing a home or renewing a lease. Rent control laws are usually enacted by municipalities, and the details vary widely. All are intended to keep living costs affordable for lower-income residents."
Rent Seeking,"Rent seeking (or rent-seeking) is an economic concept that occurs when an entity seeks to gain added wealth without any reciprocal contribution of productivity. Typically, it revolves around government-funded social services and social service programs."
Renter's Insurance,"Renter’s insurance is property insurance that provides coverage for a policyholder’s belongings, liabilities, and possibly living expenses in case of a loss event. It’s available to persons renting or subletting a single family home, apartment, duplex, condo, studio, loft, or townhouse. The policy protects against losses to the tenant’s personal property within the rented property. In addition, a renter’s insurance policy protects against losses resulting from liability claims, such as injuries occurring on the premises that are not due to a structural problem with the property (in that case the owner’s—not renter’s—policy would apply)."
Reorganization,"A reorganization is a significant and disruptive overhaul of a troubled business intended to restore it to profitability. It may include shutting down or selling divisions, replacing management, cutting budgets, and laying off workers."
Repackaging,"A private equity firm buys all the stock in a troubled public company, thus taking the company private with the intention of revamping its operations and re-selling it at a profit. This process is called repackaging."
Repatriable,Repatriable refers to the ability to move liquid financial assets from a foreign country to an investor's country of origin.
Repatriation,"Repatriation refers to converting any foreign currency into one’s local currency. Repatriation sometimes becomes necessary due to business transactions, foreign investments, or international travel."
Repayment,"Repayment is the act of paying back money previously borrowed from a lender. Typically, the return of funds happens through periodic payments, which include both principal and interest. The principal refers to the original sum of money borrowed in a loan. Interest is the charge for the privilege of borrowing money; a borrower must pay interest for the ability to use the funds released to them through the loan. Loans can usually also be fully paid in a lump sum at any time, though some contracts may include an early repayment fee."
Replacement Cost,"Replacement cost is a term referring to the amount of money a business must currently spend to replace an essential asset like a real estate property, an investment security, a lien, or another item, with one of the same or higher value. Sometimes referred to as a ""replacement value,"" a replacement cost may fluctuate, depending on factors such as the market value of components used to reconstruct or repurchase the asset and the expenses involved in preparing assets for use. Insurance companies routinely use replacement costs to determine the value of an insured item. Replacement costs are likewise ritually used by accountants, who rely on depreciation to expense the cost of an asset over its useful life. The practice of calculating a replacement cost is known as ""replacement valuation."""
Replacement Rate,"A replacement rate is the percentage of a worker's pre-retirement income that is paid out by a pension program after the worker retires. In pension systems that pay workers substantially different payouts based on their differing incomes, the replacement rate is a common measurement that can be used to determine the effectiveness of the pension system."
Representative Sample,"A representative sample is a subset of a population that seeks to accurately reflect the characteristics of the larger group. For example, a classroom of 30 students with 15 males and 15 females could generate a representative sample that might include six students: three males and three females. Samples are useful in statistical analysis when population sizes are large because they contain smaller, manageable versions of the larger group."
Repudiation,"Repudiation involves disputing the validity of a contract and refusing to honor its terms. In investing, repudiation is most relevant in fixed income securities, particularly sovereign debt. Fixed income instruments are fundamentally contracts where the borrower lends a certain amount of principal in return for payments of interest and principal on a preset schedule."
Repurchase Agreement (Repo),"A repurchase agreement (repo) is a form of short-term borrowing for dealers in government securities. In the case of a repo, a dealer sells government securities to investors, usually on an overnight basis, and buys them back the following day at a slightly higher price. That small difference in price is the implicit overnight interest rate. Repos are typically used to raise short-term capital. They are also a common tool of central bank open market operations."
Reputational Risk,Reputational risk is a threat or danger to the good name or standing of a business or entity. Reputational risk can occur in the following ways:
Request for Quote (RFQ),"A request for quote (RFQ), also known as an invitation for bid (IFB), is a process in which a company solicits select suppliers and contractors to submit price quotes and bids for the chance to fulfill certain tasks or projects. The RFQ process is especially important to businesses that need a consistent supply of a specific number of standard products. Companies may send RFQs alone or before a request for proposal (RFP)."
Requests for Proposal (RFP),"A request for proposal (RFP) is a business document that announces a project, describes it, and solicits bids from qualified contractors to complete it. Most organizations prefer to launch their projects using RFPs, and many governments always use them."
Required Minimum Distribution (RMD),"A required minimum distribution (RMD) is the amount of money that must be withdrawn from an employer-sponsored retirement plan, traditional IRA, SEP, or SIMPLE individual retirement account (IRA) by owners and qualified retirement plan participants of retirement age."
Required Rate of Return (RRR),"The required rate of return (RRR) is the minimum return an investor will accept for owning a company's stock, as compensation for a given level of risk associated with holding the stock. The RRR is also used in corporate finance to analyze the profitability of potential investment projects."
Requisition,"A requisition refers to the process of formally requesting a service or item, typically using a purchase requisition form or another standardized document. The requisition process is a standardized way of keeping track of and accounting for all requisitions made within a business."

Research and Development (R&D) Expenses,Research and development (R&D) expenses are associated directly with the research and development of a company's goods or services and any intellectual property generated in the process. A company generally incurs R&D expenses in the process of finding and creating new products or services.
Research Associate,"A research associate typically works within a research department of an investment bank or asset management firm to provide helpful data to the decision-makers who buy and sell securities for the firm. A research associate can plan, organize, and conduct research about industries, sectors, individual companies, markets, various investment vehicles, and economics."
Research Report,"A research report is a document prepared by an analyst or strategist who is a part of the investment research team in a stock brokerage or investment bank.

Reserve Bank of India (RBI),"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the central bank of India, which was established on Apr. 1, 1935, under the Reserve Bank of India Act. The Reserve Bank of India uses monetary policy to create financial stability in India, and it is charged with regulating the country’s currency and credit systems."
Reserve Currency,"A reserve currency is a large quantity of currency maintained by central banks and other major financial institutions to prepare for investments, transactions, and international debt obligations, or to influence their domestic exchange rate. A large percentage of commodities, such as gold and oil, are priced in the reserve currency, causing other countries to hold this currency to pay for these goods."
Reserve Fund,"A reserve fund is a savings account or other highly liquid asset set aside by an individual or business to meet any future costs or financial obligations, especially those arising unexpectedly. If the fund is set up to meet the costs of scheduled upgrades, less liquid assets may be used. For example, a homeowner's association often manages a reserve fund to help maintain the community and its amenities using the dues paid by homeowners."
Reserve Price,"Common to auctions, a reserve price or a reservation price is the minimum amount that a seller will accept as the winning bid. Alternatively, it is less commonly known as the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a good or service. The reserve price prevents a bidder who offers a price lower than what the owner will accept from winning the auction."
Reserve Ratio,"The reserve ratio is the portion of reservable liabilities that commercial banks must hold onto, rather than lend out or invest. This is a requirement determined by the country's central bank, which in the United States is the Federal Reserve. It is also known as the cash reserve ratio."
Reserve Requirements,"Reserve requirements are the amount of cash that banks must have, in their vaults or at the closest Federal Reserve bank, in line with deposits made by their customers. Set by the Fed's board of governors, reserve requirements are one of the three main tools of monetary policy—the other two tools are open market operations and the discount rate."
Resident Alien,"A resident alien is a foreign-born United States resident who is not a U.S. citizen. A resident alien is also known as a permanent resident or a lawful permanent resident, which means they are considered an immigrant who has been legally and lawfully recorded as a resident of the country. A resident alien must have a green card or pass a substantial presence test."
Residential Mortgage-Backed Security (RMBS),"Residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) are a debt-based security (similar to a bond), backed by the interest paid on loans for residences. The interest on loans such as mortgages, home-equity loans and subprime mortgages is considered to be something with a comparatively low rate of default and a comparatively high rate of interest, since there is a high demand for the ownership of a personal or family residence. Investors are attracted to this kind of security also want to be protected from the risk of default inherent with individual loans of this kind. This risk is mitigated by pooling many such loans to minimize the risk of an individual default."
Residual Dividend,"A residual dividend is a dividend policy that companies use when calculating the dividends to be paid to shareholders, whereby the amount of dividends paid to shareholders amounts to what profits are left over after the company has paid for its capital expenditures (CAPEX) and working capital costs."
Residual Income,"Residual income is income that one continues to receive after the completion of the income-producing work. Examples of residual income include royalties, rental/real estate income, interest and dividend income, and income from the ongoing sale of consumer goods (such as music, digital art, or books), among others. In corporate finance, residual income can be used as a measure of corporate performance, whereby a company's management team evaluates the income generated after paying all relevant costs of capital. Alternatively, in personal finance, residual income can be defined as either the income received after substantially all of the work has been completed, or as the income left over after paying all personal debts and obligations."
Residual Standard Deviation,Residual standard deviation is a statistical term used to describe the difference in standard deviations of observed values versus predicted values as shown by points in a regression analysis.
Residual Sum of Squares (RSS),"A residual sum of squares (RSS) is a statistical technique used to measure the amount of variance in a data set that is not explained by a regression model itself. Instead, it estimates the variance in the residuals, or error term."
Residual Value,"The residual value, also known as salvage value, is the estimated value of a fixed asset at the end of its lease term or useful life. In lease situations, the lessor uses the residual value as one of its primary methods for determining how much the lessee pays in periodic lease payments. As a general rule, the longer the useful life or lease period of an asset, the lower its residual value."
Resistance (Resistance Level),"Resistance, or a resistance level, is the price at which the price of an asset meets pressure on its way up by the emergence of a growing number of sellers who wish to sell at that price. Resistance levels can be short-lived if new information comes to light that changes the overall market’s attitude toward the asset, or they can be long-lasting. In terms of technical analysis, the simple resistance level can be charted by drawing a line along the highest highs for the time period being considered. Resistance can be contrasted with support."
Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC),"The Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) is a now-defunct temporary federal agency. From 1989 to 1995, it largely resolved the savings and loan (S&L) crisis of the 1980s, which resulted in about a third of such U.S. institutions failing within a 10-year span. The RTC became a massive property-management company, cleaning up what was, at the time, the largest collapse of U.S. financial institutions since the Great Depression."
Resource Curse,"The resource curse is a term used to describe a paradoxical situation in which a country underperforms economically, despite being home to valuable natural resources. The resource curse may also be called the resource trap or the paradox of plenty."
Restatement,"A restatement is an act of revising one or more of a company’s previous financial statements to correct an error.

Restructuring is a type of corporate action taken that involves significantly modifying the debt, operations, or structure of a company as a way of limiting financial harm and improving the business."
Restructuring Charge,"A restructuring charge is a one-time expense that a company pays when reorganizing its operations. Examples of one-time expenses include furloughing or laying off employees, closing manufacturing plants or shifting production to a new location. Companies undertake these moves in an effort to boost profitability, but first must take a one-off hit in the form of an upfront restructuring charge."
Resume,A resume is a formal document that a job applicant creates to itemize his or her qualifications for a position.

Retail Sales,Retail sales tracks consumer demand for finished goods by measuring the purchases of durable and non-durable goods over a defined period of time.
Retained Earnings,"Retained earnings are an important concept in accounting. The term refers to the historical profits earned by a company, minus any dividends it paid in the past. The word “retained” captures the fact that, because those earnings were not paid out to shareholders as dividends, they were instead retained by the company. For this reason, retained earnings decrease when a company either loses money or pays dividends, and increase when new profits are created."
Retainer Fee,"A retainer fee is an amount of money paid upfront to secure the services of a consultant, freelancer, lawyer, or other professional. A retainer fee is most commonly paid to individual third parties that have been engaged by the payer to perform a specific action on their behalf. These fees, almost always paid upfront, only ensure the commitment of the receiver. In addition, retainer fees usually do not represent the total final cost of the services provided."
Retention Bonus,"A retention bonus is a targeted payment or reward outside of an employee's regular salary that is offered as an incentive to keep a key employee on the job during a particularly crucial business cycle, such as a merger or acquisition, or during a crucial production period.

Return of Capital (ROC),"Return of capital occurs when an investor receives a portion of their original investment that is not considered income or capital gains from the investment. Note that a return of capital reduces an investor's adjusted cost basis. Once the stock's adjusted cost basis has been reduced to zero, any subsequent return will be taxable as a capital gain."
Return on Assets (ROA),"Return on assets (ROA) is an indicator of how profitable a company is relative to its total assets. ROA gives a manager, investor, or analyst an idea as to how efficient a company's management is at using its assets to generate earnings."
Return on Average Assets (ROAA),"Return on average assets (ROAA) is an indicator used to assess the profitability of a firm's assets, and it is most often used by banks and other financial institutions as a means to gauge financial performance. It is also known as simply return on assets (ROA)."
Return on Average Capital Employed (ROACE),"The return on average capital employed (ROACE) is a financial ratio that shows profitability versus the investments a company has made in itself. This metric differs from the related return on capital employed (ROCE) calculation, in that it takes the averages of the opening and closing capital for a period of time, as opposed to only the capital figure at the end of the period."
Return on Average Equity (ROAE),"Return on average equity (ROAE) is a financial ratio that measures the performance of a company based on its average shareholders' equity outstanding. Typically, ROAE refers to a company's performance over a fiscal year, so the ROAE numerator is net income and the denominator is computed as the sum of the equity value at the beginning and end of the year, divided by 2."
Return on Capital Employed (ROCE),"Return on capital employed (ROCE) is a financial ratio that can be used in assessing a company's profitability and capital efficiency. In other words, this ratio can help to understand how well a company is generating profits from its capital as it is put to use."
Return on Equity (ROE),"Return on equity (ROE) is a measure of financial performance calculated by dividing net income by shareholders' equity. Because shareholders' equity is equal to a company’s assets minus its debt, ROE is considered the return on net assets. ROE is considered a measure of a corporation's profitability in relation to stockholders’ equity."
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC),Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a calculation used to assess a company's efficiency at allocating the capital under its control to profitable investments. The return on invested capital ratio gives a sense of how well a company is using its capital to generate profits.
Return on Investment (ROI),"Return on investment (ROI) is a performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency or profitability of an investment or compare the efficiency of a number of different investments. ROI tries to directly measure the amount of return on a particular investment, relative to the investment’s cost."
Return on Net Assets (RONA),Return on net assets (RONA) is a measure of financial performance calculated as net profit divided by the sum of fixed assets and net working capital. Net profit is also called net income.
Return on Revenue (ROR),Return on revenue (ROR) is a measure of company profitability based on the amount of revenue generated. Return on revenue compares the amount of net income generated for each dollar of revenue.
Return on Risk-Adjusted Capital (RORAC),"The return on risk-adjusted capital (RORAC) is a rate of return measure commonly used in financial analysis, where various projects, endeavors, and investments are evaluated based on capital at risk. Projects with different risk profiles are easier to compare with each other once their individual RORAC values have been calculated."
Return on Sales (ROS),"Return on sales (ROS) is a ratio used to evaluate a company's operational efficiency. This measure provides insight into how much profit is being produced per dollar of sales. An increasing ROS indicates that a company is growing more efficiently, while a decreasing ROS could signal impending financial troubles. ROS is very closely related to a firm's operating profit margin."
Return on Total Assets (ROTA),"Return on total assets (ROTA) is a ratio that measures a company's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) relative to its total net assets. It is defined as the ratio between net income and total average assets, or the amount of financial and operational income a company receives in a financial year as compared to the average of that company's total assets."
Returned Payment Fee,"The term returned payment fee refers to a charge issued by a financial institution or another creditor when a consumer bounces a payment (i.e., your bank is unable to process the transaction due to a variety of reasons). Payments may be returned because of insufficient funds, account closures, or account freezes. Returned payment fees discourage customers from submitting checks or other forms of payment they know will not clear."
Revaluation Reserve,Revaluation reserve is an accounting term used when a company creates a line item on its balance sheet for the purpose of maintaining a reserve account tied to certain assets. This line item can be used when a revaluation assessment finds that the carrying value of the asset has changed.
Revealed Preference,"Revealed preference, a theory offered by American economist Paul Anthony Samuelson in 1938, states that consumer behavior, if their income and the item's price are held constant, is the best indicator of their preferences."
Revenue,Revenue is the income generated from normal business operations and includes discounts and deductions for returned merchandise. It is the top line or gross income figure from which costs are subtracted to determine net income.
Revenue Agent's Report (RAR),"The Revenue Agent’s Report (RAR) is a detailed document that describes an IRS examiner's audit findings and states the amount of deficiency or refund the agent finds the taxpayer to owe or be owed, respectively.﻿﻿ Taxpayers have the right to disagree with a revenue agent's report and can choose to fight the agent's findings through a formal protest to the IRS Office of Appeals division by appealing to the U.S. Tax Court, or by paying the new assessment but then suing for a refund.﻿﻿"
Revenue Bond,"A revenue bond is a category of municipal bond supported by the revenue from a specific project, such as a toll bridge, highway, or local stadium. Revenue bonds that finance income-producing projects are thus secured by a specified revenue source. Typically, revenue bonds can be issued by any government agency or fund that is managed in the manner of a business, such as entities having both operating revenues and expenses."
Revenue Cap Regulations,"Revenue cap regulation seeks to limit the amount of total revenue that can be earned by a firm operating in an industry with no or few other competitors. An industry such as this, where one or a few companies control the entire production and sale of a good or service, is known as a monopoly or a concentrated industry."
Revenue Deficit,"A revenue deficit occurs when realized net income is less than the projected net income. This happens when the actual amount of revenue and/or the actual amount of expenditures do not correspond with budgeted revenue and expenditures. This is the opposite of a revenue surplus, which occurs when the actual amount of net income exceeds the projected amount."

Revenue Officer,"A revenue officer is an individual who collects revenues, such as taxes and duties, on behalf of the government or some agency. The specific duties of a revenue officer depend on the particular organization that employs the individual."
Revenue Passenger Mile (RPM),"A revenue passenger mile (RPM) is a transportation industry metric that shows the number of miles traveled by paying passengers and is typically an airline traffic statistic. Revenue passenger miles are calculated by multiplying the number of paying passengers by the distance traveled. For example, an airplane with 100 passengers that flies 250 miles has generated 25,000 RPM."
Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR),Revenue per available room (RevPAR) is a metric used in the hospitality industry to measure hotel performance. The measurement is calculated by multiplying a hotel's average daily room rate (ADR) by its occupancy rate. RevPAR is also calculated by dividing a hotel's total room revenue by the total number of available rooms in the period being measured.
Revenue per Available Seat Mile (RASM),"Revenue per available seat mile (RASM) is a unit of measurement commonly used to compare the efficiency of various airlines. It is obtained by dividing operating income by available seat miles (ASM). Generally, the higher the RASM, the more profitable the airline under question. Revenue is represented in cents and is not solely limited to ticket sales, as other factors of efficiency and profitability are taken into account."
Revenue per Employee,Revenue per employee—calculated as a company's total revenue divided by its current number of employees—is an important ratio that roughly measures how much money each employee generates for the firm. The revenue-per-employee ratio is most useful when looking at historical changes in a company's own ratio or when comparing it against that of other companies in the same industry as part of a fundamental analysis.
Revenue per User (RPU),"Revenue per user (RPU) is a ratio used to express revenue generated by a company on a per-user basis. It is most often used by companies that generate revenue by selling subscription services and measures how robust the product usage is across the customer base. Social media sites that allow free access also use the revenue per user ratio. Since free social media sites generate revenue through ad sales, more users equal more foot traffic to their sites which equates to higher revenues from ad space. Monitoring customer usage and revenue per user is a quick litmus test for these companies to keep in touch with their financial health."
Revenue Recognition,"Revenue recognition is a generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP) that identifies the specific conditions in which revenue is recognized and determines how to account for it. Typically, revenue is recognized when a critical event has occurred, and the dollar amount is easily measurable to the company."
Reversal,"A reversal is a change in the price direction of an asset. A reversal can occur to the upside or downside. Following an uptrend, a reversal would be to the downside. Following a downtrend, a reversal would be to the upside. Reversals are based on overall price direction and are not typically based on one or two periods/bars on a chart."
Reverse Auction,"A reverse auction is a type of auction in which sellers bid for the prices at which they are willing to sell their goods and services. In a regular auction, a seller puts up an item and buyers place bids until the close of the auction, at which time the item goes to the highest bidder. In a reverse auction, the buyer puts up a request for a required good or service. Sellers then place bids for the amount they are willing to be paid for the good or service, and at the end of the auction the seller with the lowest amount wins."
Reverse Culture Shock,"Reverse culture shock is the emotional and psychological distress suffered by some people when they return home after a number of years overseas. This can result in unexpected difficulty in readjusting to the culture and values of the home country, now that the previously familiar has become unfamiliar."
Reverse ICO,"A reverse initial coin offering (ICO) is a method used by existing, established real-world businesses to issue a token to decentralize its ecosystem, raise funds, and get into cryptocurrency. These enterprises have existing products and services, and they cater to real-world customers."
Reverse Morris Trust,A reverse Morris trust (RMT) is a tax-optimization strategy in which a company wishing to spin-off and subsequently sell assets to an interested party can do so while avoiding taxes on any gains from such asset disposal.
Reverse Repurchase Agreement,"A reverse repurchase agreement, or ""reverse repo"", is the purchase of securities with the agreement to sell them at a higher price at a specific future date. For the party selling the security (and agreeing to repurchase it in the future) it is a repurchase agreement (RP) or repo; for the party on the other end of the transaction (buying the security and agreeing to sell in the future) it is a reverse repurchase agreement (RRP) or reverse repo."
Reverse Stock Split,"A reverse stock split is a type of corporate action that consolidates the number of existing shares of stock into fewer, proportionally more valuable, shares. Reducing the total number of outstanding shares in the open market can be pursued for a number of reasons, and often signals a company in distress."
Reverse Takeover (RTO),A reverse takeover (RTO) is a process whereby private companies can become publicly traded companies without going through an initial public offering (IPO).
Reverse Triangular Mergers,"A reverse triangular merger is the formation of a new company that occurs when an acquiring company creates a subsidiary, the subsidiary purchases the target company, and the subsidiary is then absorbed by the target company."
Revocable Beneficiary,"A revocable beneficiary does not have guaranteed rights to receive compensation from an entity such as an insurance policy or a trust fund. The policy owner reserves the right to make changes to who receives payment, change the terms of the policy, or terminate the policy without the need of revocable beneficiary consent. Most life insurance policies have this feature."
Revocable Trust,"A revocable trust is a trust whereby provisions can be altered or canceled dependent on the grantor or the originator of the trust. During the life of the trust, income earned is distributed to the grantor, and only after death does property transfer to the beneficiaries of the trust."
Revolver,"A revolver refers to a borrower—either an individual or a company—who carries a balance from month to month, via a revolving credit line. Borrowers are only obligated to make minimum monthly payments, which go toward paying interest and reducing principal debt. Revolvers are used in finance by corporations to fund working capital needs, which are expenses for day-to-day operations such as payroll."
Revolving Credit,"Revolving credit is an agreement that permits an account holder to borrow money repeatedly up to a set dollar limit while repaying a portion of the current balance due in regular payments. Each payment, minus the interest and fees charged, replenishes the amount available to the account holder."
Revolving Door,"The term ""revolving door"" refers to the movement of high-level employees from public-sector jobs to private-sector jobs and vice versa. The idea is that there is a revolving door between the two sectors as many legislators and regulators become lobbyists and consultants for the industries they once regulated and some private industry heads or lobbyists receive government appointments that relate to their former private posts."
Revolving Loan Facility,"A revolving loan facility is a form of credit issued by a financial institution that provides the borrower with the ability to draw down or withdraw, repay, and withdraw again. A revolving loan is considered a flexible financing tool due to its repayment and re-borrowing accommodations. It is not considered a term loan because, during an allotted period of time, the facility allows the borrower to repay the loan or take it out again. In contrast, a term loan provides a borrower with funds followed by a fixed payment schedule."
Ricardian Equivalence,Ricardian equivalence is an economic theory that says that financing government spending out of current taxes or future taxes (and current deficits) will have equivalent effects on the overall economy.
Rider,"A rider is an insurance policy provision that adds benefits to or amends the terms of a basic insurance policy. Riders provide insured parties with additional coverage options, or they may even restrict or limit coverage. There is an additional cost if a party decides to purchase a rider. Most are low in cost because they involve minimal underwriting. A rider is also referred to as an insurance endorsement. It can be added to policies that cover life, homes, autos, and rental units."
Right of First Offer,"A right of first offer is a contractual obligation that allows the right holder to purchase an asset before the owner tries to sell it to someone else. If the right holder is no longer interested in the property, the seller can then sell it to a third party. Rights of first offer are most commonly used in the real estate industry and the sale of businesses.﻿﻿"
Right of First Refusal,"Right of first refusal (ROFR), also known as first right of refusal, is a contractual right to enter into a business transaction with a person or company before anyone else can. If the party with this right declines to enter into a transaction, the obligor is free to entertain other offers. This is a popular clause among lessees of real estate because it gives them preference to the properties in which they occupy. However, it may limit what the owner could receive from interested parties competing for the property."
Right of Rescission,"The right of rescission is a right, set forth by the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) under U.S. federal law, of a borrower to cancel a home equity loan or line of credit with a new lender, or to cancel a refinance transaction done with another lender other than the current mortgagee, within three days of closing. The right is provided on a no-questions-asked basis, and the lender must give up its claim to the property and refund all fees within 20 days of exercising the right of rescission.﻿﻿"
Right-to-Work Law,"A right-to-work law gives workers the freedom to choose whether or not to join a labor union in the workplace. This law also makes it optional for employees in unionized workplaces to pay for union dues or other membership fees required for union representation, whether they are in the union or not. Right-to-work is also known as workplace freedom or workplace choice."
Rights Offering (Issue),"A rights offering (rights issue) is a group of rights offered to existing shareholders to purchase additional stock shares, known as subscription warrants, in proportion to their existing holdings. These are considered to be a type of option since it gives a company's stockholders the right, but not the obligation, to purchase additional shares in the company."
Ring-Fence,"A ring-fence is a virtual barrier that segregates a portion of an individual's or company's financial assets from the rest. This may be done to reserve money for a specific purpose, to reduce taxes on the individual or company, or to protect the assets from losses incurred by riskier operations."
Ripple,"Ripple is a term used to conceptualize the day-to-day fluctuations in stock market prices. It has been discussed throughout the evolution of Dow Theory, a basic framework for technical analysis investing."
Ripple (Cryptocurrency),"Ripple is a technology that acts as both a cryptocurrency and a digital payment network for financial transactions. It was first released in 2012; it was co-founded by Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb. Ripple's main process is a payment settlement asset exchange and remittance system, similar to the SWIFT system for international money and security transfers, which is used by banks and financial middlemen dealing across currencies."
Risk-Adjusted Return,A risk-adjusted return is a calculation of the profit or potential profit from an investment that takes into account the degree of risk that must be accepted in order to achieve it. The risk is measured in comparison to that of a virtually risk-free investment—usually U.S. Treasuries.
Risk-Adjusted Return On Capital (RAROC),"Risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC) is a modified return on investment (ROI) figure that takes elements of risk into account. In financial analysis, projects and investments with greater risk levels must be evaluated differently; RAROC thus accounts for changes in an investment’s profile by discounting risky cash flows against less-risky cash flows."
Risk Analysis,"Risk analysis is the process of assessing the likelihood of an adverse event occurring within the corporate, government, or environmental sector. Risk analysis is the study of the underlying uncertainty of a given course of action and refers to the uncertainty of forecasted cash flow streams, the variance of portfolio or stock returns, the probability of a project's success or failure, and possible future economic states."
Risk Assessment,"Risk assessment is a general term used across many industries to determine the likelihood of loss on an asset, loan, or investment. Assessing risk is essential for determining how worthwhile a specific investment is and the best process(es) to mitigate risk. It presents the upside reward compared to the risk profile. Risk assessment is important in order to determine the rate of return an investor would need to earn to deem an investment worth the potential risk."
Risk-Averse,The term risk-averse describes the investor who chooses the preservation of capital over the potential for a higher-than-average return.
Risk-Based Capital Requirement,"Risk-based capital requirement refers to a rule that establishes minimum regulatory capital for financial institutions. Risk-based capital requirements exist to protect financial firms, their investors, their clients, and the economy as a whole. These requirements ensure that each financial institution has enough capital on hand to sustain operating losses while maintaining a safe and efficient market."
Risk Control,"Risk control is the set of methods by which firms evaluate potential losses and take action to reduce or eliminate such threats. It is a technique that utilizes findings from risk assessments, which involve identifying potential risk factors in a company's operations, such as technical and non-technical aspects of the business, financial policies and other issues that may affect the well-being of the firm."
Risk-Free Asset,"A risk-free asset is one that has a certain future return—and virtually no possibility of loss. Debt obligations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (bonds, notes, and especially Treasury bills) are considered to be risk-free because the ""full faith and credit"" of the U.S. government backs them. Because they are so safe, the return on risk-free assets is very close to the current interest rate."
Risk-Free Rate Of Return,The risk-free rate of return is the theoretical rate of return of an investment with zero risk. The risk-free rate represents the interest an investor would expect from an absolutely risk-free investment over a specified period of time. The real risk-free rate can be calculated by subtracting the current inflation rate from the yield of the Treasury bond matching your investment duration.
Risk Management,"In the financial world, risk management is the process of identification, analysis, and acceptance or mitigation of uncertainty in investment decisions. Essentially, risk management occurs when an investor or fund manager analyzes and attempts to quantify the potential for losses in an investment, such as a moral hazard, and then takes the appropriate action (or inaction) given the fund's investment objectives and risk tolerance."
Risk Measures,"Risk measures are statistical measures that are historical predictors of investment risk and volatility, and they are also major components in modern portfolio theory (MPT). MPT is a standard financial and academic methodology for assessing the performance of a stock or a stock fund as compared to its benchmark index."
Risk Neutral,"Risk neutral is a concept used in both game theory studies and in finance. It refers to a mindset where an individual is indifferent to risk when making an investment decision. This mindset is not derived from calculation or rational deduction, but rather from an emotional preference. A person with a risk-neutral approach simply doesn't focus on the risk--regardless of whether or not that is an ill-advised thing to do. This mindset is often situational and can be dependent on price or other external factors."
Risk-Neutral Measures,"A risk neutral measure is a probability measure used in mathematical finance to aid in pricing derivatives and other financial assets. Risk neutral measures give investors a mathematical interpretation of the overall market’s risk averseness to a particular asset, which must be taken into account in order to estimate the correct price for that asset."
Risk-Neutral Probabilities,"Risk-neutral probabilities are probabilities of potential future outcomes adjusted for risk, which are then used to compute expected asset values. In other words, assets and securities are bought and sold as if the hypothetical fair, single probability for an outcome were a reality, even though that is not, in fact, the actual scenario."
Risk-On Risk-Off,Risk-on risk-off is an investment setting in which price behavior responds to and is driven by changes in investor risk tolerance. Risk-on risk-off refers to changes in investment activity in response to global economic patterns.
Risk Parity,Risk parity is a portfolio allocation strategy that uses risk to determine allocations across various components of an investment portfolio. The risk parity strategy modifies the modern portfolio theory (MPT) approach to investing through the use of leverage.
Risk Premium,A risk premium is the investment return an asset is expected to yield in excess of the risk-free rate of return. An asset's risk premium is a form of compensation for investors. It represents payment to investors for tolerating the extra risk in a given investment over that of a risk-free asset.
Risk Profiles,A risk profile is an evaluation of an individual's willingness and ability to take risks. It can also refer to the threats to which an organization is exposed. A risk profile is important for determining a proper investment asset allocation for a portfolio. Organizations use a risk profile as a way to mitigate potential risks and threats.
Risk-Return Tradeoff,"The risk-return tradeoff states that the potential return rises with an increase in risk. Using this principle, individuals associate low levels of uncertainty with low potential returns, and high levels of uncertainty or risk with high potential returns. According to the risk-return tradeoff, invested money can render higher profits only if the investor will accept a higher possibility of losses."
Risk Reversal,"A risk reversal is a hedging strategy that protects a long or short position by using put and call options. This strategy protects against unfavorable price movements in the underlying position but limits the profits that can be made on that position. If an investor is long a stock, they could create a short risk reversal to hedge their position by buying a put option and selling a call option."
Risk/Reward Ratio,"The risk/reward ratio marks the prospective reward an investor can earn for every dollar they risk on an investment. Many investors use risk/reward ratios to compare the expected returns of an investment with the amount of risk they must undertake to earn these returns. Consider the following example: an investment with a risk-reward ratio of 1:7 suggests that an investor is willing to risk $1, for the prospect of earning $7. Alternatively, a risk/reward ratio of 1:3 signals that an investor should expect to invest $1, for the prospect of earning $3 on their investment."
Risk Tolerance,"Risk tolerance is the degree of variability in investment returns that an investor is willing to withstand in their financial planning. Risk tolerance is an important component in investing. You should have a realistic understanding of your ability and willingness to stomach large swings in the value of your investments; if you take on too much risk, you might panic and sell at the wrong time."
Risk-Weighted Assets,Risk-weighted assets are used to determine the minimum amount of capital that must be held by banks and other financial institutions in order to reduce the risk of insolvency. The capital requirement is based on a risk assessment for each type of bank asset.
Rival Good,"A rival good is a type of product or service that can only be possessed or consumed by a single user. When a good is rival in consumption, it may be subject to strong demand and fierce competition—factors that tend to drive up prices."
Roadshow,"A roadshow is a series of presentations made in various locations leading up to an initial public offering (IPO). The roadshow is a sales pitch or promotion made by the underwriting firm and a company's management team to potential investors before going public. Roadshows generally take place in major cities and are meant to drum up interest in the upcoming offer. Potential investors are introduced to the company, its history, and its key personnel."
Robber Baron,"A robber baron is one of America’s successful industrialists during the 19th century, which was also known as the Gilded Age. A robber baron is a term that is also sometimes attributed to any successful businessperson whose practices are considered unethical or unscrupulous. This behavior can include employee or environmental abuse, stock market manipulation, or deliberately restricting output to charge higher prices."
Robinson-Patman Act,"The Robinson-Patman Act is a federal law passed in 1936 to outlaw price discrimination. The Robinson-Patman Act is an amendment to the 1914 Clayton Antitrust Act and is supposed to prevent ""unfair"" competition."
Robo Advisor,"Robo-advisors (also spelled robo-adviser or roboadvisor) are digital platforms that provide automated, algorithm-driven financial planning services with little to no human supervision. A typical robo-advisor collects information from clients about their financial situation and future goals through an online survey and then uses the data to offer advice and automatically invest client assets."
Robotic Process Automation (RPA),"Robotic process automation (RPA) occurs when basic tasks are automated through software or hardware systems that function across a variety of applications, just as human workers do. The software or robot can be taught a workflow with multiple steps and applications, such as taking received forms, sending a receipt message, checking the form for completeness, filing the form in a folder, and updating a spreadsheet with the name of the form, the date filed, and so on. RPA software is designed to reduce the burden for employees of completing repetitive, simple tasks."
Robust,"In the world of investing, robust is a characteristic describing a model's, test's, or system's ability to perform effectively while its variables or assumptions are altered. A robust concept will operate without failure and produce positive results under a variety of conditions."
Rogue Trader,"A rogue trader is a trader who acts recklessly and independently of others, usually to the detriment of the institution that employs the trader and perhaps clients. Rogue traders typically play with high-risk investments that can produce huge losses or gains."
Roll-Down Return,A roll-down return is a strategy for maximizing a bond's overall yield by exploiting the yield curve. It is dependant on the fact that the value of a bond converges to par as its maturity date approaches.
Roll Forward,"Roll forward refers to extending the expiration or maturity of an option, futures contract, or forward by closing the initial contract and opening a new longer-term contract for the same underlying asset at the then-current market price. A roll forward enables the trader to maintain the position beyond the initial expiration of the contract, since options and futures contracts have finite expiration dates. It is usually carried out shortly before expiration of the initial contract and requires that the gain or loss on the original contract be settled."
Roll Yield,"Roll yield is the amount of return generated in the futures market after an investor rolls a short-term contract into a longer-term contract and profits from the convergence of the futures price toward a higher spot or cash price. Roll yield is positive when a futures market is in backwardation, which occurs when a futures contract trades at a higher price as it approaches expiration, compared to when the contract is further away from expiration."
Rolling Returns,"Rolling returns, also known as ""rolling period returns"" or ""rolling time periods,"" are annualized average returns for a period, ending with the listed year. Rolling returns are useful for examining the behavior of returns for holding periods, similar to those actually experienced by investors."
Rollover,"A rollover may entail a number of actions, most popularly the transfer of the holdings of one retirement plan to another without creating a taxable event. A rollover may also entail reinvesting funds from a mature security into a new issue of the same or similar security, or moving a FOREX (FX) position to the following delivery date, in which case the rollover incurs a charge."
Rollover Risk,"Rollover risk is a risk associated with the refinancing of debt. Rollover risk is commonly faced by countries and companies when a loan or other debt obligation (like a bond) is about to mature and needs to be converted, or rolled over, into new debt. If interest rates have risen in the meantime, they would have to refinance their debt at a higher rate and incur more interest charges in the future—or, in case of a bond issue, pay out more in interest."
Roth 401(k),"A Roth 401(k) is an employer-sponsored investment savings account that is funded with after-tax dollars up to the plan's contribution limit. This type of investment account is well-suited for people who think they will be in a higher tax bracket in retirement than they are now, as withdrawals are tax-free. The traditional 401(k) plan, by contrast, is funded with pretax money, which results in a tax on future withdrawals.﻿﻿"
Roth IRA,"A Roth IRA is an individual retirement account (IRA) that allows qualified withdrawals on a tax-free basis provided certain conditions are satisfied. Established in 1997, it was named after William Roth, a former Delaware Senator.﻿﻿"
Round Lot,"A round lot is a standard number of securities to be traded on an exchange. In stocks, a round lot is considered 100 shares or a larger number that can be evenly divided by 100. In bonds, a round lot is usually $100,000 worth."
Routing Transit Number (RTN),A routing transit number is a nine-digit number used to identify a bank or financial institution when clearing funds for electronic transfers or processing checks in the United States. A routing transit number is also used in online banking and clearinghouses for financial transactions. Only federally chartered and state-chartered banks that are eligible to maintain an account at a Federal Reserve Bank are issued routing transit numbers.
Roy's Safety-First Criterion (SFRatio),"Roy's safety-first criterion, also known as the SFRatio, is an approach to investment decisions that sets a minimum required return for a given level of risk. Roy's safety-first criterion allows investors to compare potential portfolio investments based on the probability that the portfolio returns will fall below their minimum desired return threshold."
Royalty,"A royalty is a legally binding payment made to an individual or company for the ongoing use of their assets, including copyrighted works, franchises, and natural resources. An example of royalties would be payments received by musicians when their original songs are played on the radio or television, used in movies, performed at concerts, bars, and restaurants, or consumed via streaming services. In most cases, royalties are revenue generators specifically designed to compensate the owners of songs or property when they license out their assets for another party's use."
Rule 10b-5,"Rule 10b-5 is a regulation created under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 that targets securities fraud. This rule makes it illegal for anybody to directly or indirectly use any measure to defraud, make false statements, omit relevant information, or otherwise conduct business operations that would deceive another person in the process of conducting transactions involving stock and other securities.﻿﻿"
Rule 10b-18,"Rule 10B-18 is a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule that is intended to reduce liability for companies (and their affiliated purchasers) when the company repurchases shares of the company's common stock. Rule 10B-18 is considered a safe harbor provision. A safe harbor is a legal provision to reduce or eliminate legal or regulatory liability in certain situations as long as certain conditions are met. If the company abides by the four conditions of Rule 10B-18 when it is repurchasing the shares, the SEC will not deem the transactions in violation of anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934."
Rule 10b5-1,"Rule 10b5-1, established by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2000, allows insiders of publicly-traded corporations to set up a trading plan for selling stocks they own. It is a clarification of Rule 10b-5 (sometimes written as Rule 10b5), created under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, which is the primary vehicle for investigation of securities fraud."
Rule 144,"Rule 144 is a regulation enforced by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that sets the conditions under which restricted, unregistered, and control securities can be sold or resold. Rule 144 provides an exemption from registration requirements to sell the securities through public markets if a number of specific conditions are met. The regulation applies to all types of sellers, in addition to issuers of securities, underwriters, and dealers."
Rule 144A,The term Rule 144A refers to a legal provision that amends restrictions placed on trades of privately placed securities. This safe harbor loosens restrictions set forth by Rule 144 under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 required for sales of securities by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Rule of 70,The rule of 70 is a means of estimating the number of years it takes for an investment or your money to double. The rule of 70 is a calculation to determine how many years it'll take for your money to double given a specified rate of return. The rule is commonly used to compare investments with different annual compound interest rates to quickly determine how long it would take for an investment to grow. The rule of 70 is also referred to as doubling time.
Rule of 72,"The Rule of 72 is a quick, useful formula that is popularly used to estimate the number of years required to double the invested money at a given annual rate of return."
Rule 72(t),Rule 72(t) allows penalty-free withdrawals from IRA accounts and other tax-advantaged retirement accounts like 401(k) and 403(b) plans. It is issued by the Internal Revenue Service.
Rule of 78,"The Rule of 78 is a method used by some lenders to calculate interest charges on a loan. The Rule of 78 requires the borrower to pay a greater portion of interest in the earlier part of a loan cycle, which decreases the potential savings for the borrower in paying off their loan."
Rule of Thumb,"A rule of thumb is a heuristic guideline that provides simplified advice or some basic rule-set regarding a particular subject or course of action. It is a general principle that gives practical instructions for accomplishing or approaching a certain task. Typically, rules of thumb develop as a result of practice and experience rather than through scientific research or a theoretical foundation."
Run Rate,The run rate refers to the financial performance of a company based on using current financial information as a predictor of future performance. The run rate functions as an extrapolation of current financial performance and assumes that current conditions will continue.
Runoff Insurance,"Runoff insurance is an insurance policy provision that covers claims made against companies that have been acquired, merged, or have ceased operations. Runoff insurance, also known as closeout insurance, is purchased by the company being acquired and indemnifies—exempts from liability—the acquiring company from lawsuits against the directors and officers of the acquired company."
Russell 1000 Index,"The term Russell 1000 Index refers to a stock market index that is used as a benchmark by investors. It is a subset of the larger Russell 3000 Index and represents the 1000 top companies by market capitalization in the United States.﻿﻿ The Russell 1000 is owned and operated by FTSE Russell Group, which is based in the United Kingdom. The Russell 1000 is considered a bellwether index for large-cap investing.﻿﻿"
Russell 2000 Index,"The Russell 2000 index measures the performance of the 2,000 smaller companies that are included in the Russell 3000 Index, which itself is made up of nearly all U.S. stocks. The Russell 2000 is widely regarded as a bellwether of the U.S. economy because of its focus on smaller companies that focus on the U.S. market."
Russell 3000 Index,The Russell 3000 Index is a market-capitalization-weighted equity index maintained by FTSE Russell that provides exposure to the entire U.S. stock market.
S Corporation (S Subchapter),"An S corporation, also known as an S subchapter, refers to a type of corporation that meets specific Internal Revenue Code requirements. If it does, it may pass income (along with other credits, deductions, and losses) directly to shareholders, without having to pay federal corporate taxes. Usually associated with small businesses (100 or fewer shareholders), S corp status effectively gives a business the regular benefits of incorporation while enjoying the tax-exempt privileges of a partnership."
S&P 500 Index (Standard & Poor's 500 Index),"The S&P 500 Index, or the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, is a market-capitalization-weighted index of the 500 largest publicly-traded companies in the U.S. It is not an exact list of the top 500 U.S. companies by market capitalization because there are other criteria to be included in the index. The index is widely regarded as the best gauge of large-cap U.S. equities. Other common U.S. stock market benchmarks include the Dow Jones Industrial Average, or Dow 30, and the Russell 2000 Index, which represents the small-cap index."
S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index,The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index is a list of companies in the S&P 500 with a track record of increasing dividends for at least 25 consecutive years.
Safe Deposit Box,"A safe deposit box (or safety deposit box) is an individually secured container—usually a metal box—that stays in the safe or vault of a federally insured bank or credit union. Safe deposit boxes are used to keep valuables, important documents, and sentimental keepsakes protected. Customers rely on the security of the building and vault to safeguard their contents."
Safe Harbors,"A safe harbor is a legal provision to sidestep or eliminate legal or regulatory liability in certain situations, provided that certain conditions are met."
Safe Haven,"A safe haven is a type of investment that is expected to retain or increase in value during times of market turbulence. Investors seek out safe havens in order to limit their exposure to losses in the event of market downturns. However, what assets are actually deemed safe havens can vary depending on the specific nature of the down market. That means in order for an investment to act as a safe haven, investors must perform ample due diligence.﻿﻿"
Sale,"A sale is a transaction between two or more parties in which the buyer receives tangible or intangible goods, services, or assets in exchange for money. In some cases, other assets are paid to a seller. In the financial markets, a sale can also refer to an agreement that a buyer and seller make regarding the price of a security."
Sales and Purchase Agreement (SPA),"A sales and purchase agreement (SPA) is a binding legal contract between two parties that obligates a transaction between a buyer and a seller. SPAs are typically used for real estate transactions, but they are found in all areas of business. The agreement finalizes the terms and conditions of the sale, and it is the culmination of negotiations between the buyer and the seller."
Sales Lead,"A sales lead is a person or business who may eventually become a client. Sales lead also refers to the data that identifies an entity as a potential buyer of a product or service. Businesses gain access to sales leads through advertising, trade shows, direct mailings, third parties, and other marketing efforts.

If the data points are further from the mean, there is a higher deviation within the data set; thus, the more spread out the data, the higher the standard deviation."
Standard Error,"The standard error (SE) of a statistic is the approximate standard deviation of a statistical sample population. The standard error is a statistical term that measures the accuracy with which a sample distribution represents a population by using standard deviation.

Stochastic Oscillator,"A stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator comparing a particular closing price of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period of time. The sensitivity of the oscillator to market movements is reducible by adjusting that time period or by taking a moving average of the result. It is used to generate overbought and oversold trading signals, utilizing a 0–100 bounded range of values."
Stochastic RSI (StochRSI),The Stochastic RSI (StochRSI) is an indicator used in technical analysis that ranges between zero and one (or zero and 100 on some charting platforms) and is created by applying the Stochastic oscillator formula to a set of relative strength index (RSI) values rather than to standard price data. Using RSI values within the Stochastic formula gives traders an idea of whether the current RSI value is overbought or oversold.

Stock Appreciation Right (SAR),"Stock appreciation rights (SARs) are a type of employee compensation linked to the company's stock price during a predetermined period. SARs are profitable for employees when the company's stock price rises, which makes them similar to employee stock options (ESOs). However, employees do not have to pay the exercise price with SARs. Instead, they receive the sum of the increase in stock or cash."
Stock Compensation,"Stock compensation is a way corporations use stock options to reward employees. Employees with stock options need to know whether their stock is vested and will retain its full value even if they are no longer employed with that company. Because tax consequences depend on the fair market value (FMV) of the stock, if the stock is subject to tax withholding, the tax must be paid in cash, even if the employee was paid by equity compensation.﻿﻿"
Stock Exchange Daily Official List (SEDOL),"The stock exchange daily official list (SEDOL) is a seven-character identification code assigned to securities that trade on the London Stock Exchange and various smaller exchanges in the United Kingdom.

Stock Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF),"The term stock exchange-traded fund (ETF) refers to a security that tracks a particular set of equities. These ETFs trade on exchanges the same way normal stocks do and track equities just like an index. They can track stocks in a single industry or an entire index of equities.

Stock Quote,"A stock quote is the price of a stock as quoted on an exchange. A basic quote for a specific stock provides information, such as its bid and ask price, last traded price, and volume traded. Investors increasingly access stock quotes online or on mobile devices, such as smartphones, rather than through print media, such as newspapers and magazines. A large number of Internet portals and websites offer delayed stock quotes at no charge, with real-time stock quotes generally restricted to paying subscribers."
Stock Screener,"A stock screener is a set of tools that allow investors to quickly sort through the myriad of available stocks and increasing exchange-traded funds according to the investor’s own criteria. Stock screeners are most typically available on brokerage trading platforms (usually free), but there are also some independent subscription-based stock screeners available. Stock screeners allow investors to employ their own methodology about what makes a stock or ETF valuable (longer-term traders) or spot a potential trading opportunity (shorter-term traders)."
Stock Symbol (Ticker),"A stock symbol is a unique series of letters assigned to a security for trading purposes. Stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) can have four or fewer letters.

Stop-Loss Order,"A stop-loss order is an order placed with a broker to buy or sell a security when it reaches a certain price. Stop-loss orders are designed to limit an investor’s loss on a position in a security and are different from stop-limit orders. When a stock falls below the stop price the order becomes a market order and it executes at the next available price. For example, a trader may buy a stock and places a stop-loss order 10% below the purchase price. Should the stock drop, the stop-loss order would be activated, and the stock would be sold as a market order."
Stop Order,"A stop order is an order to buy or sell a security when its price moves past a particular point, ensuring a higher probability of achieving a predetermined entry or exit price, limiting the investor's loss, or locking in a profit. Once the price crosses the predefined entry/exit point, the stop order becomes a market order."

Straight Line Basis,"Straight line basis is a method of calculating depreciation and amortization. Also known as straight line depreciation, it is the simplest way to work out the loss of value of an asset over time. Straight line basis is calculated by dividing the difference between an asset's cost and its expected salvage value by the number of years it is expected to be used."
Straight-Through Processing (STP),Straight-through processing is an automated process done purely through electronic transfers with no manual intervention involved. Its popular uses are in payment processing as well as the processing of securities trades. Any company involved with straight-through processing will need to have the necessary systems and technical networking in place to facilitate STP efficiency.
Strategic Alliance,"A strategic alliance is an arrangement between two companies to undertake a mutually beneficial project while each retains its independence. The agreement is less complex and less binding than a joint venture, in which two businesses pool resources to create a separate business entity."
Strategic Financial Management,"Strategic financial management means not only managing a company's finances but managing them with the intention to succeed—that is, to attain the company's goals and objectives and maximize shareholder value over time. However, before a company can manage itself strategically, it first needs to define its objectives precisely, identify and quantify its available and potential resources, and devise a specific plan to use its finances and other capital resources toward achieving its goals."
Strategic Management,"Strategic management is the management of an organization’s resources to achieve its goals and objectives. Strategic management involves setting objectives, analyzing the competitive environment, analyzing the internal organization, evaluating strategies, and ensuring that management rolls out the strategies across the organization."

"Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat (SWOT) Analysis","SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis is a framework used to evaluate a company's competitive position and to develop strategic planning. SWOT analysis assesses internal and external factors, as well as current and future potential."
Structural Unemployment,"Structural unemployment is a longer-lasting form of unemployment caused by fundamental shifts in an economy and exacerbated by extraneous factors such as technology, competition, and government policy. Structural unemployment occurs because workers lack the requisite job skills or live too far from regions where jobs are available and cannot move closer. Jobs are available, but there is a serious mismatch between what companies need and what workers can offer."
Structured Finance,"Structured finance is a heavily involved financial instrument presented to large financial institutions or companies with complicated financing needs who are unsatisfied with conventional financial products. Since the mid-1980s, structured finance has become popular in the finance industry. Collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), synthetic financial instruments, collateralized bond obligations (CBOs), and syndicated loans are examples of structured finance instruments."
Structured Note,A structured note is a debt obligation that also contains an embedded derivative component that adjusts the security's risk-return profile. The return performance of a structured note will track both the underlying debt obligation and the derivative embedded within it.
Student Loan Forgiveness,"Student loan forgiveness is a release from having to repay federal student loans—in full or in part—that have been borrowed to pay for a postsecondary education. Student debt has reached an all-time high in the U.S., with an estimated 43 million Americans each owing an average of nearly $40,000. Under certain circumstances, however, some of that debt may be discharged or forgiven. Here is how student loan forgiveness works."
Subjective Probability,"Subjective probability is a type of probability derived from an individual's personal judgment or own experience about whether a specific outcome is likely to occur. It contains no formal calculations and only reflects the subject's opinions and past experience. An example of subjective probability is a ""gut instinct"" when making a trade."
Sublease,A sublease is the re-renting of property by an existing tenant to a new third party for a portion of the tenant’s existing lease contract. The sublease agreement may also be called a sublet.
Subordinated Debt,"Subordinated debt (also known as a subordinated debenture) is an unsecured loan or bond that ranks below other, more senior loans or securities with respect to claims on assets or earnings. Subordinated debentures are thus also known as junior securities. In the case of borrower default, creditors who own subordinated debt will not be paid out until after senior bondholders are paid in full.﻿﻿"
Subordination Agreement,A subordination agreement is a legal document that establishes one debt as ranking behind another in priority for collecting repayment from a debtor. The priority of debts can become extremely important when a debtor defaults on payments or declares bankruptcy.
Subprime Loan,A subprime loan is a type of loan offered at a rate above prime to individuals who do not qualify for prime-rate loans. Quite often subprime borrowers have been turned down by traditional lenders because of their low credit ratings or other factors that suggest they have a reasonable chance of defaulting on the debt repayment.
Subrogation,Subrogation is a term describing a right held by most insurance carriers to legally pursue a third party that caused an insurance loss to the insured. This is done in order to recover the amount of the claim paid by the insurance carrier to the insured for the loss.
Subscription Agreement,"A subscription agreement is an investor's application to join a limited partnership. It is also a two-way guarantee between a company and a new shareholder (subscriber). The company agrees to sell a certain number of shares at a specific price, and in return, the subscriber promises to buy the shares at the predetermined price."
Subsidiary Rights,"In the corporate world, a subsidiary is a company that belongs to another company, which is usually referred to as the parent company or the holding company."
Substantially Equal Periodic Payment (SEPP),"Substantially Equal Periodic Payment, or SEPP, is a method of distributing funds from an IRA or other qualified retirement plans prior to the age of 59½ that avoids incurring IRS penalties for the withdrawals. Typically, an individual who removes assets from a plan prior to that age will pay an early withdrawal penalty of 10% of the distributed amount."
Substitute,"A substitute, or substitutable good, in economics and consumer theory refers to a product or service that consumers see as essentially the same or similar-enough to another product. Put simply, a substitute is a good that can be used in place of another."
Substitution Effect,"The substitution effect is the decrease in sales for a product that can be attributed to consumers switching to cheaper alternatives when its price rises. A product may lose market share for many reasons, but the substitution effect is purely a reflection of frugality. If a brand raises its price, some consumers will select a cheaper alternative. If beef prices rise, many consumers will eat more chicken."
Sukuk,"A sukuk is an Islamic financial certificate, similar to a bond in Western finance, that complies with Islamic religious law commonly known as Sharia. Since the traditional Western interest-paying bond structure is not permissible, the issuer of a sukuk essentially sells an investor group a certificate, and then uses the proceeds to purchase an asset that the investor group has direct partial ownership interest in. The issuer must also make a contractual promise to buy back the bond at a future date at par value."
Sum of Squares,"Sum of squares is a statistical technique used in regression analysis to determine the dispersion of data points. In a regression analysis, the goal is to determine how well a data series can be fitted to a function that might help to explain how the data series was generated. Sum of squares is used as a mathematical way to find the function that best fits (varies least) from the data."
Sum-of-the-Parts Valuation (SOTP),The sum-of-the-parts valuation (SOTP) is a process of valuing a company by determining what its aggregate divisions would be worth if they were spun off or acquired by another company.
Summa Cum Laude,"Summa cum laude is an honorary title used by educational institutions to signify a degree that was earned ""with the highest distinction."" Summa cum laude indicates the greatest distinction of three commonly used types of academic honors, expressed in Latin, recognized in the United States. The other two are called magna cum laude and cum laude, representing degrees earned ""with great distinction"" and ""with distinction,"" respectively."
Sunk Cost,"A sunk cost refers to money that has already been spent and which cannot be recovered. In business, the axiom that one has to ""spend money to make money"" is reflected in the phenomenon of the sunk cost. A sunk cost differs from future costs that a business may face, such as decisions about inventory purchase costs or product pricing. Sunk costs are excluded from future business decisions because the cost will remain the same regardless of the outcome of a decision."
Superannuation,"A superannuation is an organizational pension program created by a company for the benefit of its employees. It is also referred to as a company pension plan. Funds deposited in a superannuation account will grow, typically without any tax implications, until retirement or withdrawal."
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP),A supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) is a set of benefits that may be made available to top-level employees in addition to those covered in the company's standard retirement savings plan.
Supply,"Supply is a fundamental economic concept that describes the total amount of a specific good or service that is available to consumers. Supply can relate to the amount available at a specific price or the amount available across a range of prices if displayed on a graph. This relates closely to the demand for a good or service at a specific price; all else being equal, the supply provided by producers will rise if the price rises because all firms look to maximize profits."
Supply Chain,"A supply chain is a network between a company and its suppliers to produce and distribute a specific product to the final buyer. This network includes different activities, people, entities, information, and resources. The supply chain also represents the steps it takes to get the product or service from its original state to the customer."
Supply Chain Finance,"Supply chain finance (SCF) is a term describing a set of technology-based solutions that aim to lower financing costs and improve business efficiency for buyers and sellers linked in a sales transaction. SCF methodologies work by automating transactions and tracking invoice approval and settlement processes, from initiation to completion. Under this paradigm, buyers agree to approve their suppliers' invoices for financing by a bank or other outside financier--often referred to as ""factors."" And by providing short-term credit that optimizes working capital and provides liquidity to both parties, SCF offers distinct advantages to all participants. While suppliers gain quicker access to money they are owed, buyers get more time to pay off their balances. On either side of the equation, the parties can use the cash on hand for other projects to keep their respective operations running smoothy."
Supply Chain Management (SCM),Supply chain management is the management of the flow of goods and services and includes all processes that transform raw materials into final products. It involves the active streamlining of a business's supply-side activities to maximize customer value and gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace.
Supply Curve,"The supply curve is a graphic representation of the correlation between the cost of a good or service and the quantity supplied for a given period. In a typical illustration, the price will appear on the left vertical axis, while the quantity supplied will appear on the horizontal axis."
Supply Shock,"A supply shock is an unexpected event that suddenly changes the supply of a product or commodity, resulting in an unforeseen change in price. Supply shocks can be negative, resulting in a decreased supply, or positive, yielding an increased supply; however, they're often negative. Assuming aggregate demand is unchanged, a negative (or adverse) supply shock causes a product's price to spike upward, while a positive supply shock decreases the price."
Support (Support Level),"Support, or a support level, refers to the price level that an asset does not fall below for period of time. An asset's support level is created by buyers entering the market whenever the asset dips to a lower price. In technical analysis, the simple support level can be charted by drawing a line along the lowest lows for the time period being considered. The support line can be flat or slanted up or down with the overall price trend. Other technical indicators and charting techniques can be used to identify more advanced versions of support."
Supranational,"A supranational organization is a multinational union or association in which member countries cede authority and sovereignty on at least some internal matters to the group, whose decisions are binding on its members. In short, member states share in decision making on matters that will affect each country's citizens."
Surcharge,"A surcharge is an extra fee, charge, or tax that is added on to the cost of a good or service, beyond the initially quoted price. Often, a surcharge is added to an existing tax and is not included in the stated price of the good or service. The charge could reflect a locality's need to collect money for extra services, a hike to defray the cost of increased commodity pricing, such as with a fuel surcharge, or an extra fee on your wireless bill for access to emergency services."
Surety,The surety is the guarantee of the debts of one party by another. A surety is an organization or person that assumes the responsibility of paying the debt in case the debtor policy defaults or is unable to make the payments.
Surplus,"A surplus describes the amount of an asset or resource that exceeds the portion that's actively utilized. A surplus can refer to a host of different items, including income, profits, capital, and goods. In the context of inventories, a surplus describes products that remain sitting on store shelves, unpurchased. In budgetary contexts, a surplus occurs when income earned exceeds expenses paid. A budget surplus can also occur within governments when there's leftover tax revenue after all government programs are fully financed."
Surplus Lines Insurance,"Surplus lines insurance protects against a financial risk that is too high for a regular insurance company to take on. Surplus line insurance can be used by companies or purchased individually. Unlike normal insurance, this insurance can be bought from an insurer not licensed in the insured’s state. However, the surplus lines insurer requires a license in the state where it is based."
Survivorship Bias,Survivorship bias or survivor bias is the tendency to view the performance of existing stocks or funds in the market as a representative comprehensive sample without regarding those that have gone bust. Survivorship bias can result in the overestimation of historical performance and general attributes of a fund or market index.
Sustainability,"Sustainability focuses on meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. The concept of sustainability is composed of three pillars: economic, environmental, and social—also known informally as profits, planet, and people. Increasingly, companies are making public commitments to sustainability through actions like reducing waste, investing in renewable energy, and supporting organizations that work toward a more sustainable future."
Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR),The sustainable growth rate (SGR) is the maximum rate of growth that a company or social enterprise can sustain without having to finance growth with additional equity or debt. The SGR involves maximizing sales and revenue growth without increasing financial leverage. Achieving the SGR can help a company prevent being over-leveraged and avoid financial distress.
Swap Execution Facility (SEF),A Swap Execution Facility (SEF) is an electronic platform provided by a corporate entity that allows participants to buy and sell swaps in a regulated and transparent manner.
Swaption (Swap Option),"A swaption, also known as a swap option, refers to an option to enter into an interest rate swap or some other type of swap. In exchange for an options premium, the buyer gains the right but not the obligation to enter into a specified swap agreement with the issuer on a specified future date."
Sweat Equity,"The term sweat equity refers to a person or company's contribution toward a business venture or other project. Sweat equity is generally not monetary and, in most cases, comes in the form of physical labor, mental effort, and time. Sweat equity is commonly found in real estate and the construction industry, as well as in the corporate world—especially for startups."
Sweep Account,"A sweep account is a bank or brokerage account that automatically transfers amounts that exceed, or fall short of, a certain level into a higher interest-earning investment option at the close of each business day. Commonly, the excess cash is swept into a money market fund."
Swing Trading,Swing trading is a style of trading that attempts to capture short- to medium-term gains in a stock (or any financial instrument) over a period of a few days to several weeks. Swing traders primarily use technical analysis to look for trading opportunities. These traders may utilize fundamental analysis in addition to analyzing price trends and patterns.
Swingline Loan,"A swingline loan is a short-term loan made by financial institutions that provides businesses with access to funds to cover debt commitments. A swingline loan can be a sub-limit of an existing credit facility or a syndicated credit line, which is financing offered by a group of lenders. Swingline loans typically have short operating durations that can range from five to 15 days on average."
Switching Costs,"Switching costs are the costs that a consumer incurs as a result of changing brands, suppliers, or products. Although most prevalent switching costs are monetary in nature, there are also psychological, effort-based, and time-based switching costs."
Symmetrical Distribution,"A symmetrical distribution occurs when the values of variables appear at regular frequencies and often the mean, median, and mode all occur at the same point. If a line were drawn dissecting the middle of the graph, it would reveal two sides that mirror one other."
Syndicate,"A syndicate is a temporary alliance of businesses that joins together to manage a large transaction, which would be difficult, or impossible, to effect individually. Syndication makes it easy for companies to pool their resources and share risks, as when a group of investment banks works together to bring a new issue of securities to the market. There are different types of syndicates, such as underwriting syndicates, banking syndicates, and insurance syndicates."
Syndicated Loan,"A syndicated loan, also known as a syndicated bank facility, is financing offered by a group of lenders—referred to as a syndicate—who work together to provide funds for a single borrower. The borrower can be a corporation, a large project, or a sovereign government. The loan can involve a fixed amount of funds, a credit line, or a combination of the two."
Synergy,"Synergy is the concept that the combined value and performance of two companies will be greater than the sum of the separate individual parts. Synergy is a term that is most commonly used in the context of mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Synergy, or the potential financial benefit achieved through the combining of companies, is often a driving force behind a merger."
Synthetic,"Synthetic is the term given to financial instruments that are engineered to simulate other instruments while altering key characteristics, like duration and cash flow."
Systematic Investment Plan (SIP),"A systematic investment plan (SIP) is a plan in which investors make regular, equal payments into a mutual fund, trading account, or retirement account such as a 401(k). SIPs allow investors to save regularly with a smaller amount of money while benefiting from the long-term advantages of dollar-cost averaging (DCA). By using a DCA strategy, an investor buys an investment using periodic equal transfers of funds to build wealth or a portfolio over time slowly."
Systematic Sampling,"Systematic sampling is a type of probability sampling method in which sample members from a larger population are selected according to a random starting point but with a fixed, periodic interval. This interval, called the sampling interval, is calculated by dividing the population size by the desired sample size. Despite the sample population being selected in advance, systematic sampling is still thought of as being random if the periodic interval is determined beforehand and the starting point is random."
"T+1 (T+2,T+3)","T+1 (T+2, T+3) are abbreviations that refer to the settlement date of security transactions. The ""T"" stands for transaction date, which is the day the transaction takes place. The numbers 1, 2, or 3 denote how many days after the transaction date the settlement—or the transfer of money and security ownership—takes place."
T Distribution,"The T distribution, also known as the Student’s t-distribution, is a type of probability distribution that is similar to the normal distribution with its bell shape but has heavier tails. T distributions have a greater chance for extreme values than normal distributions, hence the fatter tails."
T-Account,"A T-account is an informal term for a set of financial records that uses double-entry bookkeeping. The term describes the appearance of the bookkeeping entries. First, a large letter T is drawn on a page. The title of the account is then entered just above the top horizontal line, while underneath debits are listed on the left and credits are recorded on the right, separated by the vertical line of the letter T."
T-Test,"A t-test is a type of inferential statistic used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups, which may be related in certain features. It is mostly used when the data sets, like the data set recorded as the outcome from flipping a coin 100 times, would follow a normal distribution and may have unknown variances. A t-test is used as a hypothesis testing tool, which allows testing of an assumption applicable to a population."
Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA),Tactical asset allocation is an active management portfolio strategy that shifts the percentage of assets held in various categories to take advantage of market pricing anomalies or strong market sectors. This strategy allows portfolio managers to create extra value by taking advantage of certain situations in the marketplace. It is a moderately active strategy since managers return to the portfolio's original asset mix once reaching the desired short-term profits.
Taft-Hartley Act,"The Taft-Hartley Act is a 1947 U.S. federal law that extended and modified the 1935 Wagner Act. It prohibits certain union practices and requires disclosure of certain financial and political activities by unions. The bill was initially vetoed by President Truman, but Congress overrode the veto."
Tag-Along Rights,"Tag-along rights also referred to as ""co-sale rights,"" are contractual obligations used to protect a minority shareholder, usually in a venture capital deal. If a majority shareholder sells his stake, it gives the minority shareholder the right to join the transaction and sell their minority stake in the company. Tag-alongs effectively oblige the majority shareholder to include the holdings of the minority holder in the negotiations so that the tag-along right is exercised."
Taguchi Method of Quality Control,"The Taguchi method of quality control is an approach to engineering that emphasizes the roles of research and development (R&D), and product design and development in reducing the occurrence of defects and failures in manufactured goods."
Tail Risk in Investments,"Tail risk is a form of portfolio risk that arises when the possibility that an investment will move more than three standard deviations from the mean is greater than what is shown by a normal distribution. Tail risks include events that have a small probability of occurring, and occur at both ends of a normal distribution curve."
Takaful,"Takaful is a type of Islamic insurance wherein members contribute money into a pool system to guarantee each other against loss or damage. Takaful-branded insurance is based on sharia or Islamic religious law, which explains how individuals are responsible to cooperate and protect one another. Takaful policies cover health, life, and general insurance needs."
Take or Pay,"Take or pay is a provision, written into a contract, whereby one party has the obligation of either taking delivery of goods or paying a specified amount. Take or pay provisions benefit both the buyer and the seller by sharing risk, and can benefit society by facilitating trade and reducing transactions costs."
Take-Out Loan,A take-out loan is a type of long-term financing that replaces short-term interim financing. Such loans are usually mortgages that are collateralized with assets and have fixed payments that are amortizing.
Take-Profit Order (T/P),"A take-profit order (T/P) is a type of limit order that specifies the exact price at which to close out an open position for a profit. If the price of the security does not reach the limit price, the take-profit order does not get filled."
Takeover,"A takeover occurs when one company makes a successful bid to assume control of or acquire another. Takeovers can be done by purchasing a majority stake in the target firm. Takeovers are also commonly done through the merger and acquisition process. In a takeover, the company making the bid is the acquirer and the company it wishes to take control of is called the target."
Tangible Asset,A tangible asset is an asset that has a finite monetary value and usually a physical form. Tangible assets can typically always be transacted for some monetary value though the liquidity of different markets will vary. Tangible assets are the opposite of intangible assets which have a theorized value rather than a transactional exchange value.
Tangible Book Value Per Share (TBVPS),"Tangible book value per share (TBVPS) is a method by which a company’s value is determined on a per-share basis by measuring its equity without the inclusion of any intangible assets. Intangible assets are those that lack physical substance, thus making their valuation a more difficult undertaking than the valuation of tangible assets."
Tangible Common Equity (TCE),"Tangible common equity (TCE) is a measure of a company's physical capital, which is used to evaluate a financial institution's ability to deal with potential losses. Tangible common equity is calculated by subtracting intangible assets (including goodwill) and preferred equity from the company's book value."

Tangible Personal Property,"Tangible personal property is a tax term describing personal property that can be physically relocated, such as furniture and office equipment. Tangible personal property is always depreciated over either a five- or seven-year period using straight-line depreciation but is eligible for accelerated depreciation as well."
Tape Reading,"Tape reading is an old technique that day traders used to analyze the price and volume of a given stock. From roughly the 1860s through the 1960s, stock prices were transmitted over telegraph lines on ticker tape that included a ticker symbol, price, and volume. These technologies were phased out in the 1960s with the rise of personal computers and electronic communication networks (ECNs)."
Taper Tantrum,"The phrase, taper tantrum, describes the 2013 surge in U.S. Treasury yields, resulting from the Federal Reserve's (Fed) announcement of future tapering of its policy of quantitative easing. The Fed announced that it would be reducing the pace of its purchases of Treasury bonds, to reduce the amount of money it was feeding into the economy. The ensuing rise in bond yields in reaction to the announcement was referred to as a taper tantrum in financial media."

Tapering efforts are primarily aimed at interest rates and at controlling investor perceptions of the future direction of interest rates. Tapering efforts may include changing the discount rate or reserve requirements.
Target-Date Fund,"Target-date funds are mutual fund or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) structured to grow assets in a way that is optimized for a specific time frame. The structuring of these funds addresses an investor's capital needs at some future date—hence, the name ""target date."" Most often, investors will use a target date fund to apply to their onset of retirement. However, target-date funds are more frequently being used by investors working towards a future expense, such as a child's college tuition."
Target Markets,A target market refers to a group of potential customers to whom a company wants to sell its products and services. This group also includes specific customers to whom a company directs its marketing efforts. A target market is one part of the total market for a good or service.
Targeted Accrual Redemption Note (TARN),A targeted accrual redemption note (TARN) is an exotic derivative that terminates when a limit on coupon payments to the holder is reached.

Tax Avoidance,"Tax avoidance is the use of legal methods to minimize the amount of income tax owed by an individual or a business. This is generally accomplished by claiming as many deductions and credits as are allowable. It may also be achieved by prioritizing investments that have tax advantages, such as buying tax-free municipal bonds. Tax avoidance is not the same as tax evasion, which relies on illegal methods such as underreporting income and falsifying deductions."
Tax Base,"A tax base is a total amount of assets or income that can be taxed by a taxing authority, usually by the government. It is used to calculate tax liabilities. This can be in different forms, including income or property."

Tax benefits are created through tax regulation, which is determined by federal, state, and local governments."
Tax Brackets,"A tax bracket refers to a range of incomes subject to a certain income tax rate. Tax brackets result in a progressive tax system, in which taxation progressively increases as an individual’s income grows. Low incomes fall into tax brackets with relatively low income tax rates, while higher earnings fall into brackets with higher rates."
Tax Break,A tax break is a reduction of a taxpayer’s total liability. The term is also used to refer to the favorable tax treatment of any class of people in the United States.
Tax Credit,"A tax credit is an amount of money that taxpayers can subtract directly from taxes owed to their government. Unlike deductions, which reduce the amount of taxable income, tax credits reduce the actual amount of tax owed. The value of a tax credit depends on the nature of the credit; certain types of tax credits are granted to individuals or businesses in specific locations, classifications, or industries."
Tax-Deductible Interest,"Tax-deductible interest is a borrowing expense that a taxpayer can claim on a federal or state tax return to reduce taxable income. Types of interest that are tax deductible include mortgage interest for both first and second (home equity) mortgages, mortgage interest for investment properties, student loan interest, and the interest on some business loans, including business credit cards."
Tax Deduction,A tax deduction is a deduction that lowers a person’s or an organization’s tax liability by lowering their taxable income. Deductions are typically expenses that the taxpayer incurs during the year that can be applied against or subtracted from their gross income to figure out how much tax is owed.
Tax Deed,"The term “tax deed” refers to a legal document granting ownership of a property to a government body when the owner fails to pay any associated property taxes. A tax deed gives the government agency the authority to sell the property to collect the delinquent taxes. Once sold, the property is then transferred to the purchaser. These transactions are called “tax deed sales” and are usually held at auctions.﻿﻿﻿ ﻿﻿﻿"

Tax-Equivalent Yield,The tax-equivalent yield is the return that a taxable bond would need to equal the yield on a comparable tax-exempt municipal bond. The calculation is a tool that investors can use to compare the returns between a tax-free investment and a taxable alternative.
Tax Evasion,Tax evasion is an illegal activity in which a person or entity deliberately avoids paying a true tax liability. Those caught evading taxes are generally subject to criminal charges and substantial penalties. To willfully fail to pay taxes is a federal offense under the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax code.
Tax Exempt,"Tax-exempt refers to income or transactions that are free from tax at the federal, state, or local level. The reporting of tax-free items may be on a taxpayer's individual or business tax return and shown for informational purposes only. The tax-exempt article is not part of any tax calculations."
Tax-Exempt Interest,"Tax-exempt interest is interest income that is not subject to federal income tax. In some cases, the amount of tax-exempt interest a taxpayer earns can limit the taxpayer's qualification for certain other tax breaks. The most common sources of tax-exempt interest come from municipal bonds or income-producing assets inside of Roth retirement accounts."
Tax Expense,"A tax expense is a liability owed to federal, state/provincial, and/or municipal governments within a given period, typically over the course of a year."
Tax Fraud,Tax fraud occurs when an individual or business entity willfully and intentionally falsifies information on a tax return to limit the amount of tax liability. Tax fraud essentially entails cheating on a tax return in an attempt to avoid paying the entire tax obligation. Examples of tax fraud include claiming false deductions; claiming personal expenses as business expenses; using a false Social Security number; and not reporting income.
Tax Free,"Tax free refers to certain types of goods and financial securities (such as municipal bonds) that are not taxed. It also refers to earnings that are not taxed. The tax free status of these goods, investments, and income may incentivize individuals and business entities to increase spending or investing, resulting in economic stimulus. Tax free may also be known as tax-exempt."
Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA),"A tax-free savings account (TFSA) is an account in which contributions, interest earned, dividends, and capital gains are not taxed, and can be withdrawn tax-free.﻿﻿ While it's called a savings account, a TFSA can hold certain investments including mutual funds, securities, and bonds as well as cash.﻿﻿ This account is available to individuals ages 18 and older in Canada and can be used for any purpose.﻿﻿"
Tax Haven,A tax haven is generally an offshore country that offers foreign individuals and businesses little or no tax liability in a politically and economically static environment.

It is required information on all tax returns filed with the IRS. All U.S. tax identification numbers (TIN) or tax I.D. numbers are issued directly by the IRS except Social Security numbers (SSNs), which are issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA).﻿﻿ Foreign tax identifying numbers (foreign TIN) are also not issued by the IRS; rather, they are issued by the country in which the non-U.S. taxpayer pays taxes."
Tax Incidence,"Tax incidence (or incidence of tax) is an economic term for understanding the division of a tax burden between stakeholders, such as buyers and sellers or producers and consumers. Tax incidence can also be related to the price elasticity of supply and demand. When supply is more elastic than demand, the tax burden falls on the buyers. If demand is more elastic than supply, producers will bear the cost of the tax."
Tax Liability,"Tax liability is the total amount of tax debt owed by an individual, corporation, or other entity to a taxing authority like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In other words, it is the total amount of tax you're responsible for paying to the taxman. Tax liabilities are incurred when income is earned, when there is a gain on the sale of an asset, or when another taxable event occurs. No tax liability means a taxpayer's total tax was zero in the prior year, or they did not have to file a tax return."
Tax Lien,"A tax lien is a legal claim against the assets of an individual or business that fails to pay taxes owed to the government. In general, a lien serves to guarantee payment of a debt such as a loan, or in this case, taxes. If the obligation is not satisfied, the creditor may proceed to seize the assets."

Tax Loss Harvesting,"Tax-loss harvesting is the selling of securities at a loss to offset a capital gains tax liability. This strategy is typically employed to limit the recognition of short-term capital gains. Short-term capital gains are generally taxed at a higher federal income tax rate than long-term capital gains.﻿﻿ However, the method may also offset long-term capital gains."
Tax Planning,Tax planning is the analysis of a financial situation or plan to ensure that all elements work together to allow you to pay the lowest taxes possible. A plan that minimizes how much you pay in taxes is referred to as tax efficient. Tax planning should be an essential part of an individual investor's financial plan. Reduction of tax liability and maximizing the ability to contribute to retirement plans are crucial for success.
Tax Rate,"A tax rate is the percentage at which an individual or corporation is taxed. The United States (both the federal government and many of the states) uses a progressive tax rate system, in which the percentage of tax charged increases as the amount of the person's or entity's taxable income increases. A progressive tax rate results in a higher dollar amount collected from taxpayers with greater incomes."
Tax Reform Act of 1986,"The Tax Reform Act of 1986 is a law passed by the United States Congress to simplify the income tax code. To increase fairness and provide an incentive for growth in the economy, the passage of the Act reduced the maximum rate on ordinary income and raised the tax rate on long-term capital gains."

Tax selling allows the investor to avoid paying capital gains tax on recently sold or appreciated assets."
Tax Shelter,"A tax shelter is a vehicle used by individuals or organizations to minimize or decrease their taxable incomes and, therefore, tax liabilities. Tax shelters are legal, and can range from investments or investment accounts that provide favorable tax treatment, to activities or transactions that lower taxable income through deductions or credits."
Tax-Sheltered Annuity,"A tax-sheltered annuity is a type of investment vehicle that lets an employee make pretax contributions into a retirement account from income. Because the contributions are pretax, IRS does not tax the contributions and related benefits until the employee withdraws them from the plan. Since the employer can also make direct contributions to the plan, the employee gains the benefit of having additional tax-free funds accruing."
Tax Shield,"A tax shield is a reduction in taxable income for an individual or corporation achieved through claiming allowable deductions such as mortgage interest, medical expenses, charitable donations, amortization, and depreciation. These deductions reduce a taxpayer's taxable income for a given year or defer income taxes into future years. Tax shields lower the overall amount of taxes owed by an individual taxpayer or a business."
Tax Table,"A tax table is a chart that displays the amount of tax due based on income received. The tax rate in the table may be shown as a discrete amount, a percentage rate, or a combination of both. Tax tables are used by individuals, companies, and estates for both standard income and capital gains."
Tax-to-GDP Ratio,"A tax-to-GDP ratio is a gauge of a nation's tax revenue relative to the size of its economy as measured by gross domestic product (GDP). The ratio provides a useful look at a country's tax revenue because it reveals potential taxation relative to the economy. It also enables a view of the overall direction of a nation's tax policy, as well as international comparisons between the tax revenues of different countries."
Tax Treaty,"A tax treaty is a bilateral (two-party) agreement made by two countries to resolve issues involving double taxation of passive and active income of each of their respective citizens. Income tax treaties generally determine the amount of tax that a country can apply to a taxpayer's income, capital, estate, or wealth. ﻿﻿ An income tax treaty is also called a Double Tax Agreement (DTA).﻿﻿"

It can be described broadly as adjusted gross income (AGI) minus allowable itemized or standard deductions. Taxable income includes wages, salaries, bonuses, and tips, as well as investment income and various types of unearned income."
Taxable Wage Base,"The taxable wage base is the maximum amount of earned income that employees must pay Social Security taxes on. Generally, the employee's gross wages will be equal to the taxable wage base. Typically, an employer will handle this calculation and withhold the correct amount of taxes from each of the employee's paychecks; however, the employee is still responsible for reporting the tax."
Taxation,"Taxation is a term for when a taxing authority, usually a government, levies or imposes a financial obligation on its citizens or residents. Paying taxes to governments or officials has been a mainstay of civilization since ancient times."

The term has its origin in a slogan of the American colonials against their British rulers: ""Taxation without representation is tyranny.""﻿﻿"
Taxes,"Taxes are mandatory contributions levied on individuals or corporations by a government entity—whether local, regional or national. Tax revenues finance government activities, including such public works and services as roads and schools, or programs like Social Security and Medicare. In economics, taxes fall on whomever pays the burden of the tax, whether this is the entity being taxed, such as a business, or the end consumers of the business's goods."
Taxpayer,"A taxpayer may be an individual or business entity that is obligated to pay taxes to a federal, state, or local government. Taxes from both individuals and businesses are a primary source of revenue for governments. In the United States, individual taxpayers are usually required to file and pay both federal and state tax returns annually. Businesses must also file annual returns but usually plan for and pay regular estimated tax payments throughout the year."
Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN),"A taxpayer identification number (TIN) is a unique nine-digit number used to identify an individual, business, or other entity in tax returns and other documents filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). A TIN is typically either a Social Security number or an employer identification number (EIN), depending on the entity that it is being issued to. The TIN is also known as the 95-number or the tax-ID number."
Taylor's Rule,The Taylor rule (sometimes referred to as Taylor's rule or Taylor principle) is an econometric model that describes the relationship between Federal Reserve operating targets and the rates of inflation and gross domestic product growth. The Taylor rule has been interpreted both as a way to forecast Fed monetary policy and as a fixed rule policy to guide monetary policy in response to changes in economic conditions. The rule consists of a formula that relates the Fed's operating target for short-term interest rates to two factors: the deviation between actual and desired inflation rates and the deviation between real GDP growth and the desired GDP growth rates.

During the period of time when a new rights offering is announced up until three days before the subscription rights expire (known as the cum rights period), the value of the right is specific and can easily be calculated. To calculate the value of a right during the window in which it is effective, and investor must be told the subscription price and the number of rights required to buy one share of stock. With that information the value of the right can be calculated using the following formula:"
Theory of Price,The theory of price is an economic theory that states that the price for any specific good or service is based on the relationship between its supply and demand.

Tier 1 Common Capital Ratio,"Tier 1 common capital ratio is a measurement of a bank's core equity capital, compared with its total risk-weighted assets, and signifies a bank's financial strength. The Tier 1 common capital ratio is utilized by regulators and investors because it shows how well a bank can withstand financial stress and remain solvent. Tier 1 common capital excludes any preferred shares or non-controlling interests, which makes it differ from the closely-related tier 1 capital ratio."
Tier 1 Leverage Ratio,The Tier 1 leverage ratio measures a bank's core capital relative to its total assets. The ratio looks specifically at Tier 1 capital to judge how leveraged a bank is based on its assets. Tier 1 capital are those assets that can be easily liquidated if a bank needs capital in the event of a financial crisis. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is thus a measure of a bank's near-term financial health.
Tier 2 Capital,"The term tier 2 capital refers to one of the components of a bank's required reserves. Tier 2 is designated as the second or supplementary layer of a bank's capital and is composed of items such as revaluation reserves, hybrid instruments, and subordinated term debt.

Time Horizon,"An investment time horizon, or just time horizon, is the period of time one expects to hold an investment until they need the money back. Time horizons are largely dictated by investment goals and strategies.

Times Interest Earned (TIE),The times interest earned (TIE) ratio is a measure of a company's ability to meet its debt obligations based on its current income. The formula for a company's TIE number is earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) divided by the total interest payable on bonds and other debt.
Time Value of Money (TVM),"The time value of money (TVM) is the concept that money you have now is worth more than the identical sum in the future due to its potential earning capacity. This core principle of finance holds that provided money can earn interest, any amount of money is worth more the sooner it is received. TVM is also sometimes referred to as present discounted value."
Time-Weighted Rate of Return (TWR),The time-weighted rate of return (TWR) is a measure of the compound rate of growth in a portfolio. The TWR measure is often used to compare the returns of investment managers because it eliminates the distorting effects on growth rates created by inflows and outflows of money. The time-weighted return breaks up the return on an investment portfolio into separate intervals based on whether money was added or withdrawn from the fund.
Times-Revenue Method,"The times-revenue method is a valuation method used to determine the maximum value of a company. The times-revenue method uses a multiple of current revenues to determine the ""ceiling"" (or maximum value) for a particular business. Depending on the industry and the local business and economic environment, the multiple might be one to two times the actual revenues. However, in some industries, the multiple might be less than one."
TINA (There is No Alternative),"There is no alternative, often abbreviated as ""TINA,"" is a phrase that originated with the Victorian philosopher Herbert Spencer and later became a slogan for British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. Today, it is often used by investors to explain a less-than-ideal portfolio allocation, usually of stocks, because other asset classes offer even worse returns. This situation and the subsequent decisions of investors can lead to the ""TINA Effect"" whereby stocks rise only because investors have no viable alternative."
Tit for Tat,"Tit for tat is a game-theory strategy subject to a payoff matrix like that of a prisoner's dilemma. Tit for tat was introduced by Anatol Rapoport, who developed a strategy in which each participant in an iterated prisoner's dilemma follows a course of action consistent with his opponent's previous turn.﻿﻿ For example, if provoked, a player subsequently responds with retaliation; if unprovoked, the player cooperates. The tit-for-tat strategy is not exclusive to economics. It is used in many fields, including psychology and sociology. In biology, it is likened to reciprocal altruism."

Pass-through securities issued by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and Ginnie Mae trade in the TBA market, and the term TBA is derived from the fact that the actual mortgage-backed security that will be delivered to fulfill a TBA trade is not designated at the time the trade is made. These securities are announced 48 hours prior to the established trade settlement date."

To arrive at its total, usually expressed as a percentage, TSR factors in capital gains and dividends from a stock; it might also include special distributions, stock splits, and warrants. Whichever way it is calculated, TSR means the same thing: the sum total of what a stock has returned to those who invested in it."
Total Utility,"Total utility is the aggregate amount of satisfaction or fulfillment that a consumer receives through the consumption of a specific good or service. Total utility is often compared to marginal utility, which is the satisfaction a consumer receives from consuming one additional unit of a good or service.

Tragedy of the Commons,"The tragedy of the commons is an economics problem in which every individual has an incentive to consume a resource, but at the expense of every other individual -- with no way to exclude anyone from consuming. Initially it was formulated by asking what would happen if every shepherd, acting in their own self-interest, allowed their flock to graze on the common field. If everybody does act in their apparent own best interest, it results in harmful over-consumption (all the grass is eaten, to the detriment of everyone)"

The TILA was implemented by the Federal Reserve Board through a series of regulations. Some of the most important aspects of the act concern the information that must be disclosed to a borrower before extending credit, such as the annual percentage rate (APR), the term of the loan, and the total costs to the borrower. This information must be conspicuous on documents presented to the borrower before signing and in some cases on the borrower’s periodic billing statements."

Twenty Eight Thirty Six Rule (28/36 Rule),"The term 28/36 rule refers to a common-sense rule used to calculate the amount of debt an individual or household should assume. According to this rule, a household should spend a maximum of 28% of its gross monthly income on total housing expenses and no more than 36% on total debt service, including housing and other debt such as car loans and credit cards. Lenders often use this rule to assess whether to extend credit to borrowers."
Two and Twenty,"Two and twenty (or ""2 and 20"") is a fee arrangement that is standard in the hedge fund industry and is also common in venture capital and private equity. Hedge fund management companies typically charge clients both a management and a performance fee. ""Two"" means 2% of assets under management (AUM), and refers to the annual management fee charged by the hedge fund for managing assets. ""Twenty"" refers to the standard performance or incentive fee of 20% of profits made by the fund above a certain predefined benchmark. While this lucrative fee arrangement has resulted in many hedge fund managers becoming extremely wealthy, in recent years the fee structure has come under fire from investors and politicians for varying reasons."
Two-Bin Inventory Control,"Two-bin inventory control is a system used to determine when items or materials used in production should be replenished. When items in the first bin have been depleted, an order is placed to refill or replace them. The second bin is then supposed to have enough items to last until the order for the first bin arrives. In short, the first bin has a minimum of working stock, and the second bin keeps reserve stock or remaining material."
Two-Tailed Tests,"In statistics, a two-tailed test is a method in which the critical area of a distribution is two-sided and tests whether a sample is greater than or less than a certain range of values. It is used in null-hypothesis testing and testing for statistical significance. If the sample being tested falls into either of the critical areas, the alternative hypothesis is accepted instead of the null hypothesis."
Two-Way ANOVA,ANOVA stands for analysis of variance and tests for differences in the effects of independent variables on a dependent variable. A two-way ANOVA test is a statistical test used to determine the effect of two nominal predictor variables on a continuous outcome variable.
Tying,"Tying is an often illegal arrangement where, in order to buy one product, the consumer must also purchase another product that exists in a separate market. Tying falls under the wider legal umbrella of illegal competition that was originally censured by the Sherman Antitrust Act and refined in later acts. The distinction between tying (illegal) and bundling (legal within limits) is an important one for businesses to understand. Tying is also referred to as ""product tying"" or ""tied selling."""
Type II Errors,"A type II error is a statistical term used within the context of hypothesis testing that describes the error that occurs when one accepts a null hypothesis that is actually false. A type II error produces a false negative, also known as an error of omission. For example, a test for a disease may report a negative result, when the patient is, in fact, infected. This is a type II error because we accept the conclusion of the test as negative, even though it is incorrect."
tZero,tZero (t0) is a distributed ledger platform and cryptocurrency launched by the Internet retail company Overstock. It was developed to give greater legitimacy and oversight to initial coin offerings (ICOs) and to allow companies to create and issue tokenized assets for investors.

U-Shaped Recovery,"A U-shaped recovery is a type of economic recession and recovery that resembles a U shape when charted. A U-shaped recovery represents the shape of the chart of certain economic measures, such as employment, GDP, and industrial output. This shape occurs when the economy experiences a sharp decline in these metrics without a clearly defined trough but instead a period of stagnation followed by a relatively healthy rise back to its previous peak. A U-shaped recovery is similar to a V-shaped recovery except that the economy spends a longer time slogging along the bottom of the recession rather than immediately rebounding."
Uberrimae Fidei Contract,"An uberrimae fidei contract is a legal agreement, common to the insurance industry, requiring the highest standard of good faith during disclosure of all material facts that could influence the decision of the other party.

The index increases in value as the price moves farther away from a recent high and falls as the price rises to new highs. The indicator is usually calculated over a 14-day period, with the Ulcer Index showing the percentage drawdown a trader can expect from the high over that period."
Ultimate Mortality Table,"An ultimate mortality table lists the percentage of life insurance purchasers expected to still be alive at each given age, beginning with age 0, which represents 100% of the population, up to age 120. Typically, the data is based on a population of life insurance policyholders from either a particular insurance company or group of them, rather than the entire U.S. population."
Ultimate Net Loss,"Ultimate net loss is a party's total financial obligation when an insured event occurs. The insured's ultimate net loss from costs such as property damage, medical expenses and legal fees will be offset by the portion of the loss that is paid by the insurance company (usually the amount of the claim that exceeds the insured's deductible, up to the policy maximum). Thus, the insured's loss will often be limited to the policy deductible unless the total loss exceeds the policy maximum."
Ultimate Oscillator,The Ultimate Oscillator is a technical indicator that was developed by Larry Williams in 1976 to measure the price momentum of an asset across multiple timeframes. By using the weighted average of three different timeframes the indicator has less volatility and fewer trade signals compared to other oscillators that rely on a single timeframe. Buy and sell signals are generated following divergences. The Ultimately Oscillator generates fewer divergence signals than other oscillators due to its multi-timeframe construction.
Ultimogeniture,"Ultimogeniture, also known as postremogeniture or junior right, is a system of inheritance whereby the youngest son gains possession of his deceased father's estate. Many rural areas of medieval England used this system, as well as parts of France. It often applied to farmland, but sometimes included other types of land in addition to personal property."

Ultra-Short Bond Fund,"An ultra-short bond fund is a bond fund that invests only in fixed-income instruments with very short-term maturities. An ultra-short bond fund will invest in instruments with maturities of less than one year. Because of their focus on bonds with very short durations, these portfolios offer minimal interest-rate sensitivity and therefore lower risk and total return potential. This strategy, however, tends to offer higher yields than money market instruments with fewer price fluctuations than a typical short-term fund."
Ultra Vires Acts,Ultra vires acts are any acts that lie beyond the authority of a corporation to perform. Ultra vires acts fall outside the powers that are specifically listed in a corporate charter or law. This can also refer to any action that is specifically prohibited by the corporate charter.
Ultrafast Trading,Ultrafast trading is a method of trading stocks by using computers and algorithms to execute trades within milliseconds of market changes.
Umbrella Insurance Policy,"An umbrella insurance policy is extra liability insurance coverage that goes beyond the limits of the insured's homeowners, auto, or watercraft insurance.

It also protects against libel, vandalism, slander, and invasion of privacy."
Umbrella Personal Liability Policy,"An umbrella personal liability policy is extra liability coverage which goes beyond the limits of the insured’s home, auto or other liability coverage. It provides an additional layer of security to those who are at risk of high loss if they injure someone else, or someone’s property. An umbrella policy provides broad coverage, meaning that some claims which would not be covered by a standard policy may have coverage under the umbrella policy."
Umpire Clause,n umpire clause refers to language in an insurance policy that provides for a means of resolution by an unbiased third party if an insurer and an insured cannot agree on the amount of a claim payment. An umpire clause is the same thing as an arbitration clause. The arbitration process requires both the insurance company and the policy holder to hire an appraiser of their choosing to assess the damages and the cost to repair them. The umpire will agree with one or perhaps both of the resulting appraisals and that amount will be used to satisfy the claim.﻿﻿

They are among the expenses for which an insurer has to set aside reserve funds, in addition to allocated loss adjustment expenses and contingent commissions."
Unamortized Bond Discount,"An unamortized bond discount is an accounting methodology for certain bonds. The unamortized bond discount is the difference between the par value of a bond—its value at maturity—and the proceeds from the sale of the bond by the issuing company, less the portion that has already been amortized (written off in gradual increments) on the profit and loss statement."
Unamortized Bond Premium,"An unamortized bond premium refers to the difference between a bond's face value and its sale price. If a bond is sold at a discount, for instance, at 90 cents on the dollar, the issuer must still repay the full 100 cents of face value at par. Since this interest amount has not yet been paid to bondholders, it is a liability for the issuer."
Unappropriated Retained Earnings,"Unappropriated retained earnings consist of any portion of a company's retained earnings that are not classified as appropriated retained earnings. Appropriated retained earnings are set aside by the board and are assigned to a specific purpose, such as factory construction, hiring new labor, buying new equipment, or marketing. They will not be distributed to shareholders as dividend payments. Unappropriated retained earnings can be passed on to shareholders in the form of dividend payments."

Uncovered Interest Arbitrage,"Uncovered interest arbitrage is a form of arbitrage that involves switching from a domestic currency that carries a lower interest rate to a foreign currency that offers a higher rate of interest on deposits. With uncovered interest arbitrage, there is a foreign exchange risk implicit in this transaction since the investor or speculator will need to convert the foreign currency deposit proceeds back into the domestic currency sometime in the future."
Uncovered Interest Rate Parity (UIP),Uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) theory states that the difference in interest rates between two countries will equal the relative change in currency foreign exchange rates over the same period. It is one form of interest rate parity (IRP) used alongside covered interest rate parity.

Underapplied overhead is normally reported as a prepaid expense on a company's balance sheet and is balanced by inputting a debit to the cost of goods sold (COGS) section by the end of the year. Costs of goods sold are the direct cost associated with the production of goods sold by a company. The amount of underapplied overhead is referred to as an unfavorable variance.
Underbanked,"The term underbanked refers to individuals or families who have a bank account but often rely on alternative financial services such as money orders, check-cashing services, and payday loans rather than on traditional loans and credit cards to manage their finances and fund purchases.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ This may be because they lack access to convenient, affordable banking services or because they need or prefer to use alternatives to traditional financial services."

Underemployment,"Underemployment is a measure of employment and labor utilization in the economy that looks at how well the labor force is being utilized in terms of skills, experience, and availability to work. People who are classified as underemployed include those workers who are highly skilled but working in low paying or low skill jobs, and part-time workers who would prefer to be full-time. This is different from unemployment in that the person is working but not at their full capability."
Underemployment Equilibrium,"Underemployment equilibrium is a condition where underemployment in an economy is persistently above the norm and has entered an equilibrium state. This, in turn, is a result of the unemployment rate being consistently above the natural rate of unemployment or non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) due to sustained economic weakness."
Underfunded Pension Plan,"An underfunded pension plan is a company-sponsored retirement plan that has more liabilities than assets. In other words, the money needed to cover current and future retirements is not readily available. This means there is no assurance that future retirees will receive the pensions they were promised or that current retirees will continue to get their previously established distribution amount. An underfunded pension may be contrasted with a fully-funded or overfunded pension."

However, other examples of the shadow economy exist as well."
Underinsurance,"Underinsurance refers to an insufficient insurance policy. Although a good insurance policy won’t prevent any of life’s calamities, it should make the financial consequences easier to bear. Underinsurance, however, can leave the enrollee liable for a large financial expense if a serious event occurs. Whether it’s a home damaged by a hurricane or fire, or an insured person experiencing a serious disease or accident, insurance should ideally cover enough of the expense that the policyholder can manage the difference."
Underinsured Motorist Coverage,"Underinsured motorist coverage is an addition to your auto insurance policy. It protects you if you're in an accident involving someone who doesn't have sufficient insurance of their own. In an accident, the insurance of the at-fault person is supposed to compensate the other injured person.

Underinsured Motorist Coverage Limits Trigger,The underinsured motorist coverage limits trigger is one of the two triggers that can be specified by an insured party to protect against losses caused by an accident with a driver who has insufficient insurance.
Underinsured Motorist Endorsement,"In the insurance industry, an underinsured motorist endorsement is a type of supplemental insurance commonly purchased as part of an automobile insurance policy.

Underlying Option Security,"An underlying option security is a stock, index, bond, currency, or commodity on which an option's value is based. It is the primary component of how the option gets its value. This is the reason why options are classed as derivatives. They derive their value from the performance or price action of an underlying security."
Underlying Profit,"Underlying profit is a calculation made internally by a company to show what it believes is a more accurate reflection of how much money it generates. The number focuses on regular accounting cycle events and often excludes one-time charges or infrequent occurrences.

These qualifying factors include the credit history, income, work status, and other existing debts."
Unsecured Creditors,"An unsecured creditor is an individual or institution that lends money without obtaining specified assets as collateral.

Unstated Interest Paid,"Unstated interest paid is the amount of money the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assumes has been paid to the seller of an item that has been sold on an installment basis. Unstated interest must be calculated in some cases when you have sold an item on installment basis, but have charged the customer little or no interest. Because interest income must sometimes be treated differently than other types of income, it may be necessary to estimate which portion of an installment payment is actually interest income.﻿﻿"
Unsterilized Foreign Exchange Intervention,"The term unsterilized foreign exchange intervention refers to how a country's monetary authorities influence exchange rates and its money supply—by not purchasing foreign or by not selling domestic currencies or assets. This kind of approach is considered passive to exchange rate fluctuations, allowing for fluctuations in the monetary base."

For an unweighted stock index, one stock's performance will not have a dramatic effect on the performance of the index as a whole."
Unwind,"To unwind is to close out a trading position, with the term tending to be used when the trade is complex or large. Unwinding also refers to the correction of a trading error, since correcting a trading error may be complex or require multiple steps or trades. For example, a broker mistakenly sells part of a position when an investor wanted to add to it. The broker would have to unwind the transaction by first buying the sold shares and then purchasing the shares that should have been purchased in the first place."
Up/Down Gap Side-by-Side White Lines,"The side-by-side white lines pattern is a three-candle continuation pattern that occurs on candlestick charts. The up version is a large up (white or green) candle followed by a gap and then two more white candles of similar size to each other.

Up-Front Mortgage Insurance (UFMI),"Up-front mortgage insurance is an insurance premium that is collected, typically on Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans, at the time the loan is initially made. Though similar, it is not quite the same as private mortgage insurance (PMI), which is collected by a conventional private mortgage lender each month when a buyer's down payment on a home is less than 20% of the purchase price. Up-front mortgage premiums are added to a pool of money that is used to help entities, such as the FHA, insure loans for certain borrowers."

It allows a group of stocks to be equally weighted and more easily evaluated by investors, analysts, and other financial professionals."
Value Deflation,"Value deflation, or shrinkflation, occurs when retailers and service providers cut their costs and sell smaller packages, give out smaller portions, or generally provide less for the same price so as to maintain the same sticker price. Businesses may do this as a way of stealthily raising prices when costs are rising and consumers are particularly price conscious. Economy-wide value deflation is actually a form of price inflation to the extent that it results in lower real consumption at the same price level. Value deflation can lead to an understatement of the rate of inflation and the cost of living if it is not accounted for in the calculation of price indexes."
Value Engineering,"Value engineering is a systematic, organized approach to providing necessary functions in a project at the lowest cost. Value engineering promotes the substitution of materials and methods with less expensive alternatives, without sacrificing functionality.

Value Trap,"A value trap is a stock or other investment that appears to be cheaply priced because it has been trading at low valuation metrics, such as multiples in terms of price to earnings (P/E), price to cash flow (P/CF), or price to book value (P/B) for an extended time period. A value trap can attract investors who are looking for a bargain because they seem inexpensive relative to historical valuation multiples of the stock or relative to those of industry peers or the prevailing market multiple. The danger of a value trap presents itself when the stock continues to languish or drop further after an investor buys into the company."
Valued Marine Policy Definition,"A valued marine policy is a type of marine insurance coverage that places a specific value on the insured property, such as the hull or cargo of a shipping vessel, prior to a claim being made.

In business, however, a vanilla strategy must allow for some innovation as competitive advantage can weaken over time for many products and services."
What Is a Vanishing Premium?,"A vanishing premium is a periodic fee paid for an insurance policy that continues until the cash value of the policy grows enough to cover the fee. At that point, the premium ""vanishes"" as payments are no longer necessary, but are instead covered by the policy's internal value and dividend stream."

Variability,"Variability, almost by definition, is the extent to which data points in a statistical distribution or data set diverge—vary—from the average value, as well as the extent to which these data points differ from each other. In financial terms, this is most often applied to the variability of investment returns. Understanding the variability of investment returns is just as important to professional investors as understanding the value of the returns themselves. Investors equate a high variability of returns to a higher degree of risk when investing."
Variable Annuitization,"Variable Annuitization is an annuity option in which the amount of income payments received by the policyholder will vary according to the investment performance of the annuity. Variable annuitization is one option that can be selected by the policyholder during the annuitization phase of a contract, which is the phase in which the policyholder exchanges the accumulated value of the annuity for a stream of regular income payments guaranteed for life or guaranteed for a specified number of years."

Examples of variable costs include a manufacturing company's costs of raw materials and packaging—or a retail company's credit card transaction fees or shipping expenses, which rise or fall with sales. A variable cost can be contrasted with a fixed cost."
Variable Cost-Plus Pricing,"Variable cost-plus pricing is a pricing method whereby the selling price is established by adding a markup to total variable costs. The expectation is that the markup will contribute to meeting all or a part of the fixed costs and yield some level of profit. Variable cost-plus pricing is particularly useful in competitive scenarios, such as contract bidding, but it is not suitable in situations where fixed costs are a major component of total costs."

Variable Overhead Spending Variance,"A spending variance is the difference between the actual amount of a particular expense and the expected (or budgeted) amount of an expense. To understand what variable overhead spending variance is, it helps to know what a variable overhead is. Variable overhead is a cost associated with running a business that fluctuates with operational activity. As production output increases or decreases, variable overheads move in tandem. Overheads are typically a fixed cost, for example, administrative expenses. Variable overheads, on the other hand, are tied to production levels."

Variance Equation,"The term variance refers to a statistical measurement of the spread between numbers in a data set. More specifically, variance measures how far each number in the set is from the mean and thus from every other number in the set. Variance is often depicted by this symbol: σ2. It is used by both analysts and traders to determine volatility and market security. The square root of the variance is the standard deviation (σ), which helps determine the consistency of an investment’s returns over a period of time."
Variance Inflation Factor,"Variance inflation factor (VIF) is a measure of the amount of multicollinearity in a set of multiple regression variables. Mathematically, the VIF for a regression model variable is equal to the ratio of the overall model variance to the variance of a model that includes only that single independent variable. This ratio is calculated for each independent variable. A high VIF indicates that the associated independent variable is highly collinear with the other variables in the model."

Visible Supply,"Visible supply is the amount of a good or commodity that is currently being stored or transported that is available to be bought or sold. This supply is important as it identifies a definite quantity of goods available for purchase or delivery upon the assignment of futures contracts. For instance, all of the wheat held in granaries or storage facilities, along with the wheat being transported from farms constitutes part of the visible supply."
Vision Care Insurance,"Vision care insurance will often cover routine eye health expenses such as eye exams, contact lens fittings, contact lenses, and eyeglass lenses and frames and may provide a discount on LASIK procedures. The plan may cover the cost of these items in full, up to a preset limit, or it may require the policyholder to pay a flat fee or percentage fee to share the expense with the insurer."
VIX (CBOE Volatility Index),"The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is a real-time index that represents the market's expectations for the relative strength of near-term price changes of the S&P 500 index (SPX). Because it is derived from the prices of SPX index options with near-term expiration dates, it generates a 30-day forward projection of volatility. Volatility, or how fast prices change, is often seen as a way to gauge market sentiment, and in particular the degree of fear among market participants."
VIX Option,"A VIX option is a non-equity index option that uses the CBOE Volatility Index as its underlying asset. Call and put VIX options are both available. The call options hedge portfolios against a sudden market decline, and put options hedge against a rapid reversal of short positions on the S&P 500 index. These options thus allow traders and investors to speculate on future moves in volatility."
Vladimir Lenin,Vladimir Ilyich Lenin was the architect of Russia’s 1917 Bolshevik revolution and the first leader of what became the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Through violent means he imposed a system of Marxist socialism called communism on the former empire that attempted a redistribution of wealth intended to abolish the aristocracy and create a more equitable society for the masses.
Vocational Degree,"A vocational degree is an academic certificate awarded to students who have completed the degree requirements for a specific trade or career. Vocational degrees are popular because they typically require less time to complete than a traditional degree program (e.g., associate or bachelor's degree), and upon completion, the student is often ready to begin working the trade. A college undergraduate degree focuses on developing an individual's all-around intelligence and critical-thinking skills, but may not prepare an individual for a specific job. However, vocational degrees offer training for careers, such as medical coding and billing, auto mechanics, cosmetology, electrical work, and legal secretary work."
Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP),"Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) is communications technology that allows users to interact by audio through an Internet connection, rather than through an analog connection.

Void Contract,"A void contract is a formal agreement that is effectively illegitimate and unenforceable from the moment it is created. A void contract differs from a voidable contract because, while a void contract is one that was never legally valid to begin with (and will never be enforceable at any future point in time), voidable contracts may be legally enforceable once underlying contractual defects are corrected. At the same time, void contracts and voidable contracts can be nullified for similar reasons."
Void Transaction,A void transaction is a transaction that is canceled by a merchant or vendor before it settles through a consumer's debit or credit card account.

Wage-Price Spiral,"The wage-price spiral is a macroeconomic theory used to explain the cause-and-effect relationship between rising wages and rising prices, or inflation. The wage-price spiral suggests that rising wages increase disposable income raising the demand for goods and causing prices to rise. Rising prices increase demand for higher wages, which leads to higher production costs and further upward pressure on prices creating a conceptual spiral."
Wage Push Inflation,"Wage push inflation is an overall rise in the cost of goods that results from a rise in wages. To maintain corporate profits after an increase in wages, employers must increase the prices they charge for the goods and services they provide. The overall increased cost of goods and services has a circular effect on the wage increase; eventually, as goods and services in the market overall increase, higher wages will be needed to compensate for the increased prices of consumer goods."

Under normal circumstances, the probate court must issue a public notice regarding proceedings pertaining to the probate of Charley's will. However, if Michael, Sally, and Melissa--all of whom have deeply vested interests in Charley's assets, consent to waivers of notice, an appointed administrator or executor may attend in their places. By sending such representatives in their stead, courts can accelerate the the probate process, thus benefitting Charley's heirs by ultimately allowing them to receive their inheritances faster, as a result."
Waiver of Premium for Disability,"Waiver of premium for disability is a provision in an insurance policy that states the insurance company will not require the insured to pay the premium if they are seriously injured. Insurance companies can vary in their definition of a disability, and policies can vary on when and for how long they will waive a premium in the event of a disability.

Warehouse-to-Warehouse Clause,A warehouse-to-warehouse clause is a provision in an insurance policy that provides for coverage of cargo in transit from one warehouse to another. A warehouse-to-warehouse clause usually covers cargo from the moment it leaves the origin warehouse until the moment it arrives at the destination warehouse. Separate coverage is necessary to insure goods before and after the transit process.
Warehouser's Liability Form,"A warehouser’s liability form is a document that describes the obligations of a storage facility toward its customers. Warehouse owners and operators can be held liable if the goods being stored in their warehouse are destroyed, damaged, or stolen.

Wash-Out Round,"A wash-out round (also known as ""burn-out round"" or ""cram-down deal"") is when a round of new financing usurps control of previous equity holders. When such financing is done, the new issuance drastically dilutes the ownership stake of previous investors and owners. New investors are thus able to take control of the company because the previous owners are in desperate need of more financing to avoid bankruptcy. Wash-out rounds are most often associated with smaller companies or with startup ventures that lack financial stability or a strong management team."
Wash Sale,"A wash sale is a transaction in which an investor seeks to maximize tax benefits by selling a losing security at the end of a calendar year so they can claim a capital loss on taxes that year. The investor's intent is likely to repurchase the security again after the start of the new year, if possible even lower than where they sold. Such wash sales are a method investors have historically considered to recognize a tax loss without limiting their exposure to opportunity they perceive in owning a particular security. The IRS uses the wash-sale rule to eliminate the incentive to arbitrarily sell and reacquire the same security around the end of the calendar years."
Wash-Sale Rule,"The wash-sale rule is an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulation that prevents a taxpayer from taking a tax deduction for a security sold in a wash sale. The rule defines a wash sale as one that occurs when an individual sells or trades a security at a loss and, within 30 days before or after this sale, buys a ""substantially identical"" stock or security, or acquires a contract or option to do so. A wash sale also results if an individual sells a security, and the individual's spouse or a company controlled by the individual buys a substantially equivalent security.﻿﻿"
Wash Trading,"Wash trading is a process whereby a trader buys and sells a security for the express purpose of feeding misleading information to the market. In some situations, wash trades are executed by a trader and a broker who are colluding with each other, and other times wash trades are executed by investors acting as both the buyer and the seller of the security. Wash trading is illegal under U.S. law, and the IRS bars taxpayers from deducting losses that result from wash trades from their taxable income."

Waterfall Payment,"Waterfall payment structures require that higher-tiered creditors receive interest and principal payments, while the lower-tiered creditors receive principal payments after the higher-tiered creditors are paid back in full. Debtors typically structure these schemes into such tranches to prioritize the highest-principal loans first because they are also likely the most expensive."
Wave,"The term Elliott Wave Theory refers to a theory in technical analysis used to describe price movements in the financial market. The theory was developed by Ralph Nelson Elliott after he observed and identified recurring, fractal wave patterns. Waves can be identified in stock price movements and in consumer behavior.

It has the potential to benefit society by automating time-consuming tasks and by analyzing data in ways that humans sometimes can’t. Weak AI can be contrasted to strong AI, a theoretical form of machine intelligence that is equal to human intelligence."
Weak Dollar,"A weak dollar refers to a downward price trend in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies. The most commonly compared currency is the Euro, so if the Euro is rising in price compared to the dollar, the dollar is said to be weakening at that time.

These investors will quickly close their positions when a trade does not move in their favor.
Weak Shorts,"Weak shorts refer to traders or investors who hold a short position in a stock or other financial asset who will close it out at the first indication of price strength. Weak shorts are typically investors with limited financial capacity, which may preclude them from taking on too much risk on a single short position. A weak short will generally have a tight stop-loss order in place on the short position to cap the loss on the short trade in case it goes against the trader. Weak shorts are conceptually similar to weak longs, though the latter employ long positions."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is a price-weighted average that compares each security based on the stock's price relative to the sum of all the stocks' prices. The S&P 500 Index and Nasdaq Composite Index, on the other hand, are based on market capitalization, where each company is measured relative to its market value."

Wrongful termination claims involve an alleged violation of federal or state anti-discrimination laws, oral and written employment agreements/contracts, or labor laws, including collective bargaining laws or whistleblower laws. Employees who feel their termination was a form of sexual harassment or in retaliation for having filed a complaint against the employer may also file a wrongful termination claim."
X-Efficiency,"X-efficiency refers to the degree of efficiency maintained by firms under conditions of imperfect competition. Efficiency in this context means a company getting the maximum outputs from its inputs, including employee productivity and manufacturing efficiency. In a highly competitive market, firms are forced to be as efficient as possible to ensure strong profits and continued existence. This is not true in situations of imperfect competition, such as with a monopoly or duopoly."
X-Mark Signature,"An X-mark signature is made by a person in lieu of an actual signature. Due to illiteracy or disability, a person may be unable to append a full signature in name to a document as an attestation that its content has been reviewed and approved. In order to be legally valid, the X-mark signature must be witnessed."
XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language),"XBRL or eXtensible Business Reporting Language is a software standard that was developed to improve the way in which financial data is communicated, making it easier to compile and share this data. Notably, eXtensible Business Reporting Language is an implementation of XML (extensible markup language), which is a specification that is used for organizing and defining data online."
XCD (Eastern Caribbean Dollar),"XCD is the symbol for the Eastern Caribbean dollar, which is the official currency shared by eight Caribbean island countries: Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines."
XD,XD is a symbol used to signify that a security is trading ex-dividend. It is an alphabetic qualifier that acts as shorthand to tell investors key information about a specific security in a stock quote. Sometimes X alone is used to indicate that the stock is trading ex-dividend.
Xenocurrency,"The term xenocurrency refers to any currency that is traded in markets outside of its domestic borders. Its name derives from the Greek prefix “xeno”, meaning “foreign”."
Xetra,"Xetra is a trading technology platform that is operated by Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse (FWB), the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. It offers electronic trading in stocks, funds, bonds, warrants, and commodities contracts."
XML (Extensible Markup Language),"Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a flexible markup language for structured electronic documents. Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a programming language commonly used by data-exchange services (like blog feeds) to send information between otherwise incompatible systems. It is readable by both humans and computers and is based on SGML (standard generalized markup language), an international standard for electronic documents. Many other languages, such as RSS and XHTML, are based on XML."
XRT,XRT is an extension printed after the ticker symbol for a stock. It indicates that the stock is trading on an ex-rights basis. (XRT is an abbreviation for the word ex-rights.) Ex-rights means that the buyer of the stock does not have the rights to purchase more shares at a lower price anymore because those rights have expired. XRT is printed on the ticker tape—or displayed on the electronic ticker—for clarity and to avoid disputes or confusion about where the rights currently remain.
Y,Y is a letter that appears on a stock symbol specifying that a particular stock is an American depositary receipt (ADR). A stock symbol (also known as a ticker symbol) is a unique series of letters that are a shorthand way of identifying a company's specific stock. A stock symbol can include a letter at the end of the symbol that conveys information about that stock's trading status. These symbols help investors differentiate one type of investment from another.
Y-Share,"Y-shares are an institutional share class offered in open-end mutual funds. Targeting institutional investors, the share class often has a high minimum investment, beginning at approximately $25,000. This share class also offers the benefit of waived or limited load charges and lower comparative total annual fees."
Y2K,"Y2K is the shorthand term for ""the year 2000."" Y2K was commonly used to refer to a widespread computer programming shortcut that was expected to cause extensive havoc as the year changed from 1999 to 2000."
Yacht Insurance,"A yacht, it’s fair to say, is a luxury item and so particularly in need of protection. Yacht insurance is an insurance policy that provides indemnity liability coverage for a sailing vessel. It includes liability coverage for bodily injury or damage to the property of others and damage to personal property on the vessel. Depending on the insurance provider, this insurance could also include gas delivery, towing, and assistance if your yacht gets stranded."
Yale School of Management,"Yale School of Management (Yale SOM) is Yale University's graduate business school. Yale School of Management offers both MBA and Ph.D. level programs and is known for, among other things, its focus on finance and ethics. The school introduced a new kind of integrated curriculum that combines a brief period of foreign study with organizational and employee analysis."
Yankee Bond,"A Yankee bond is a debt obligation issued by a foreign entity, such as a government or company, which is traded in the United States and denominated in U.S. dollars."
Yankee CD,A Yankee certificate of deposit (CD) is a type of CD that is issued in the United States by a branch of a foreign bank. Yankee CDs are denominated in U.S. dollars and are used by foreign banks to raise capital from U.S. investors.
Yankee Certificate of Deposit,A Yankee certificate of deposit (CD) is a type of CD that is issued in the United States by a branch of a foreign bank. Yankee CDs are denominated in U.S. dollars and are used by foreign banks to raise capital from U.S. investors.
Yard,"The term ""yard"" is a financial term meaning one billion. The term is derived from the term ""milliard,"" which is used in some European languages and is equivalent to the number one billion used in American English."
Year-End Bonus,"A year-end bonus (sometimes called a ""Christmas bonus"") is a reward paid to an employee at the end of the year. Many year-end bonuses are tied to performance metrics, and the amount can vary depending on whether certain milestones are met. Year-end bonuses are usually made up of lump-sum payments used to reward the individual for hard work and dedication."
Year-Over-Year (YOY),Year-Over-Year (YOY) is a frequently used financial comparison for comparing two or more measurable events on an annualized basis.
Year to Date (YTD),"Year to date (YTD) refers to the period of time beginning the first day of the current calendar year or fiscal year up to the current date. YTD information is useful for analyzing business trends over time or comparing performance data to competitors or peers in the same industry. The acronym often modifies concepts such as investment returns, earnings and net pay."
Yearly Probability of Dying,Yearly probability of dying is a numerical figure that depicts the likelihood of someone dying per year. The yearly probability of dying is determined by looking at a mortality table which shows the rate of death at each age in terms of the number of deaths per thousand. The data in the chart is determined by dividing the number of people dying during a given year by the number of people alive at the beginning of that same year.
Yearly Probability of Living,"The yearly probability of living is a statistical concept that measures the likelihood that a given person, or group of people, will survive for one more year. It is widely used in the insurance industry to underwrite life insurance contracts. Generally speaking, older individuals will have a lower yearly probability of living and will therefore likely be charged higher insurance premiums."
Yearly Rate of Return Method,"The yearly rate of return method, commonly referred to as the annual percentage rate, is the amount earned on a fund throughout an entire year. The yearly rate of return is calculated by taking the amount of money gained or lost at the end of the year and dividing it by the initial investment at the beginning of the year. This method is also referred to as the annual rate of return or the nominal annual rate."
Yearly Renewable Term (YRT),"A yearly renewable term is a one-year term life insurance policy. This type of policy gives policyholders a quote for the year the coverage is bought. When someone buys a yearly renewable term insurance policy, the premium quoted is for a one-year term, starting in the current year."
Yearly Renewable Term Plan of Reinsurance,The yearly renewable term plan of reinsurance is a type of life reinsurance where mortality risks of an insurance company are transferred to a reinsurer through a process referred to as cession.
Years Certain Annuity,"A years certain annuity is a retirement income product that pays the holder a continuous periodic income, generally monthly, for a specified number of years. Like all annuities, it is used to provide a steady income during retirement. However, what makes a years certain annuity unique is that it provides that income for a predetermined length of time regardless of how long the annuitant lives."
Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE),The Canadian government sets the year's maximum pensionable earnings (YMPE) figure. The YMPE determines the maximum amount on which to base contributions to the Canada or Quebec Pension Plan (C/QPP). The YMPE specifies the earnings amount that can be used in calculating pension contributions for each year.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿
Yellow Knight,"A yellow knight is a company that was orchestrating a hostile takeover attempt, but then backs out of it and proposes a merger of equals with the target company instead."
Yellow Sheets,"Yellow sheets, published by NQB, are bulletins which contain information, such as yield, volume, high, low, closing, and bid-ask spread, for corporate bonds listed on the over-the-counter (OTC) market."
Yen ETF,"A yen ETF is an exchange traded fund (ETF) that tracks the relative value of Japan’s currency, the Japanese yen (JPY), in the foreign exchange (forex) market against a basket of other currencies or a single currency such as the U.S. dollar (USD). This is achieved by investing primarily in yen-backed assets, including short-term debt instruments and bonds, or simply holding the spot currency in interest-bearing accounts."
Yield-Based Option,A yield-based option allows investors to buy or sell calls and puts on the yield of a security rather than its price.
Yield Basis,"The yield basis is a method of quoting the price of a fixed-income security as a yield percentage, rather than as a dollar value. This allows bonds with varying characteristics to be easily compared. The yield basis is calculated by dividing the coupon amount paid annually by the bond purchase price."
Yield Curve Risk,"The yield curve risk is the risk of experiencing an adverse shift in market interest rates associated with investing in a fixed income instrument. When market yields change, this will impact the price of a fixed-income instrument. When market interest rates, or yields, increase, the price of a bond will decrease, and vice versa."
Yield Equivalence,"Yield equivalence is the interest rate on a taxable security that would generate a return equivalent to the return of a tax-exempt security, and vice versa."
Yield Maintenance,Yield maintenance is a sort of prepayment penalty that allows investors to attain the same yield as if the borrower made all scheduled interest payments up until the maturity date. It dictates that borrowers pay the rate differential between the loan interest rate and the prevailing market interest rate on the prepaid capital for the period remaining to loan maturity.
Yield on Cost (YOC),"Yield on cost (YOC) is a measure of dividend yield calculated by dividing a stock's current dividend by the price initially paid for that stock. For example, if an investor purchased a stock five years ago for $20, and its current dividend is $1.50 per share, then the YOC for that stock would be 7.5%."
Yield on Earning Assets,The yield on earning assets is a popular financial solvency ratio that compares a financial institution’s interest income to its earning assets. Yield on earning assets indicates how well assets are performing by looking at how much income they bring in.
Yield Pickup,Yield pickup is the additional interest rate an investor receives by selling a lower-yielding bond and buying a higher-yielding bond. The yield pickup is done to improve the risk-adjusted performance of a portfolio.
Yield Spread,"A yield spread is the difference between yields on differing debt instruments of varying maturities, credit ratings, issuer, or risk level, calculated by deducting the yield of one instrument from the other. This difference is most often expressed in basis points (bps) or percentage points."
Yield Spread Premium,"A yield spread premium also called a ""YSP"" is a form of compensation that a mortgage broker, acting as the intermediary, receives from the original lender for selling an interest rate to a borrower that is above the lender's par rate for which the borrower qualifies."
Yield Tilt Index Fund,"A yield tilt index fund is a type of fund that invests in stocks or securities that mirrors the holdings of a market index but contains a higher weighting towards higher-yielding investments. A yield tilt index fund can be a mutual fund, which is a basket of securities that are actively managed by a portfolio or fund manager."
Yield to Average Life,Yield-to-average life is the calculation of a bond's yield based on the average maturity rather than the stated maturity date of the issue. This yield replaces the stated final maturity with the average life maturity. Average life is also called the weighted average maturity (WAM) or weighted average life (WAL).
Yield to Call,"Yield to call (YTC) is a financial term that refers to the return a bondholder receives if the bond is held until the call date, which occurs sometime before it reaches maturity. This number can be mathematically calculated as the compound interest rate at which the present value of a bond's future coupon payments and call price is equal to the current market price of the bond."
Yield to Maturity (YTM),"Yield to maturity (YTM) is the total return anticipated on a bond if the bond is held until it matures. Yield to maturity is considered a long-term bond yield but is expressed as an annual rate. In other words, it is the internal rate of return (IRR) of an investment in a bond if the investor holds the bond until maturity, with all payments made as scheduled and reinvested at the same rate."
Yield to Worst (YTW),Yield to worst is a measure of the lowest possible yield that can be received on a bond that fully operates within the terms of its contract without defaulting. It is a type of yield that is referenced when a bond has provisions that would allow the issuer to close it out before it matures. Early retirement of the bond could be forced through a few different provisions detailed in the bond’s contract—most commonly callability.
Yield Variance,"Yield variance is the difference between actual output and standard output of a production or manufacturing process, based on standard inputs of materials and labor. The yield variance is valued at standard cost. Yield variance is generally unfavorable, where the actual output is less than the standard or expected output, but it can be that output expects expectations as well."
Yo-Yo,"Yo-yo is a slang term for a very volatile market. The name comes from the movements of a yo-yo toy; in a yo-yo market, security prices continually go up and down."
York Antwerp Rules,The York Antwerp Rules are a set of maritime regulations concerning protocols surrounding jettisoned cargo.
Yugen Kaisha (YK),"Yugen kaisha (YKA) is a type of limited liability company that could be established in Japan from 1940 through early 2006. The Companies Act enacted in Japan in June 2005 abolished the YK business form. The law changed most YKs into KKs, or kabushiki kaisha, a joint stock company, which is the most common business form in Japan. The corporation law also changed the corporate governance of YKs."
Yuppie,"Yuppie is a slang term denoting the market segment of young urban professionals. A yuppie is often characterized by youth, affluence, and business success. They are often preppy in appearance and like to show off their success by their style and possessions."
Advertising,"Many firms advertise their goods or services, but are they wasting economic resources? Some economists reckon that advertising merely manipulates consumer tastes and creates desires that would not otherwise exist. By increasing product differentiation and encouraging brand loyalty advertising may make consumers less price sensitive, moving the market further from perfect competition towards imperfect competition (see monopolistic competition) and increasing the ability of firms to charge more than marginal cost. Heavy spending on advertising may also create a barrier to entry, as a firm entering the market would have to spend a lot on advertising too."
Agency costs,"These can arise when somebody (the principal) hires somebody else (the agent) to carry out a task and the interests of the agent conflict with the interests of the principal. An example of such principal-agent problems comes from the relationship between the shareholders who own a public company and the managers who run it. The owners would like managers to run the firm in ways that maximise the value of their shares, whereas the managers' priority may be, say, to build a business empire through rapid expansion and mergers and acquisitions, which may not increase their firm's share price."
Agricultural policy,"Countries often provide support for their farmers using trade barriers and subsidy because, for example:"
Agriculture,"Farming around the world continues to become more productive while generally accounting for a smaller share of employment and national income, although in some poor countries it remains the sector on which the country and its people depend. Farming, forestry and fishing in 1913 accounted for 28% of employment in the United States, 41% in France and 60% in Japan, but only 12% in the UK. Now the proportion of the workforce employed in such activities has dropped below 6% in these and most other industrialised countries."
Aid,See international aid.
Altruism,"It is often alleged that altruism is inconsistent with economic rationality, which assumes that people behave selfishly. Certainly, much economic analysis is concerned with how individuals behave, and homo economicus (economic man) is usually assumed to act in his or her self-interest. However, self-interest does not necessarily mean selfish. Some economic models in the field of behavioural economics assume that self-interested individuals behave altruistically because they get some benefit, or utility, from doing so. For instance, it may make them feel better about themselves, or be a useful insurance policy against social unrest, say. Some economic models go further and relax the traditional assumption of fully rational behaviour by simply assuming that people sometimes behave altruistically, even if this may be against their self-interest. Either way, there is much economic literature about charity, international aid, public spending and redistributive taxation."
Amortisation,"The running down or payment of a loan by instalments. An example is a repayment mortgage on a house, which is amortised by making monthly payments that over a pre-agreed period of time cover the value of the loan plus interest. With loans that are not amortised, the borrower pays only interest during the period of the loan and then repays the sum borrowed in full."
Animal spirits,"The colourful name that keynes gave to one of the essential ingredients of economic prosperity: confidence. According to Keynes, animal spirits are a particular sort of confidence, ""naive optimism"". He meant this in the sense that, for entrepreneurs in particular, ""the thought of ultimate loss which often overtakes pioneers, as experience undoubtedly tells us and them, is put aside as a healthy man puts aside the expectation of death"". Where these animal spirits come from is something of a mystery. Certainly, attempts by politicians and others to talk up confidence by making optimistic noises about economic prospects have rarely done much good."
Arbitrage pricing theory,"This is one of two influential economic theories of how assets are priced in the financial markets. The other is the capital asset pricing model. The arbitrage pricing theory says that the price of a financial asset reflects a few key risk factors, such as the expected rate of interest, and how the price of the asset changes relative to the price of a portfolio of assets. If the price of an asset happens to diverge from what the theory says it should be, arbitrage by investors should bring it back into line."
Asian crisis,"During 1997-98, many of the East Asian tiger economies suffered a severe finanical and economic crisis. This had big consequences for the global financial markets, which had become increasingly exposed to the promise that Asia had seemed to offer. The crisis destroyed wealth on a massive scale and sent absolute poverty shooting up. In the banking system alone, corporate loans equivalent to around half of one year's GDP went bad - a destruction of savings on a scale more usually associated with a full-scale war. The precise cause of the crisis remains a matter of debate. Fingers have been pointed at the currency peg adopted by some countries, and a reduction of capital controls in the years before the crisis. Some blamed economic contagion. The crisis brought an end to a then widespread belief that there was a distinct ""Asian way"" of capitalism that might prove just as successful as capitalism in America or Europe. Instead, critics turned their fire on Asian cronyism, ill-disciplined banking and lack of transparency. In the years following the crisis, most of the countries involved have introduced reforms designed to increase transparency and improve the health of the banking system, although some (such as South Korea) went much further than others (such as Indonesia)."
Assets,Things that have earning power or some other value to their owner.
Asymmetric shock,"When something unexpected happens that affects one economy (or part of an economy) more than the rest. This can create big problems for policymakers if they are trying to set a macroeconomic policy that works for both the area affected by the shock and the unaffected area. For instance, some economic areas may be oil exporters and thus highly dependent on the price of oil, but other areas are not. If the oil price plunges, the oil-dependent area would benefit from policies designed to boost demand that might be unsuited to the needs of the rest of the economy. This may be a constant problem for those responsible for setting the interest rate for the euro given the big differences--and different potential exposures to shocks--among the economies within the euro zone."
Auctions,"Going, going, gone. Holding an auction can be an extremely efficient way for a seller to set the price of its products, especially if it does not have much information about how much people may be willing to pay for them. Auctions fascinate economists, especially those who specialise in game theory. They have long been a feature of the sale of art and antiques in the rooms of firms such as Sotheby's and Christie's. But in recent years they have played a growing role in other parts of the economy, ranging from the allocation of government-controlled broadcasting bandwidth to the awarding of work to subcontractors by governments and big firms using competitive tendering, and even more recently the sale of goods over the Internet."
Austrian economics,"A brand of neo-classical economics established in Vienna during the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. It was strongly opposed to Marxism and, more broadly, to the use of economic theories to justify government intervention in the economy. Prominent members included Friedrich hayek, Joseph schumpeter and Ludwig von Mises. It gave birth to the definition of economics as the science of studying human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means that have alternative uses. Austrian economic thinking was characterised by attributing all economic activity, including the behaviour of apparently impersonal institutions, to the wishes and actions of individuals. It did this by examining choices in terms of their opportunity cost (that is, what is the next best use of resources to that which is being considered?) and by analysing the impact of timing on decision making."
Average,"A number that is calculated to summarise a group of numbers. The most commonly used average is the mean, the sum of the numbers divided by however many numbers there are in the group. The median is the middle value in a group of numbers ranked in order of size. The mode is the number that occurs most often in a group of numbers. Take the following group of numbers: 1, 2, 2, 9, 12, 13, 17"
Barriers to entry (or exit),How firms keep out competition--an important source of incumbent advantage. There are four main sorts of barriers.
Basel 1 and 2,"An attempt to reduce the number of bank failures by tying a bank's capital adequacy ratio to the riskiness of the loans it makes. For instance, there is less chance of a loan to a government going bad than a loan to, say, an internet business, so the bank should not have to hold as much capital in reserve against the first loan as against the second. The first attempt to do this worldwide was by the Basel committee for international banking supervision in 1988. However, its system of judging the relative riskiness of different loans was crude. For instance, it penalised banks no more for making loans to a fly-by-night software company in Thailand than to Microsoft; no more for loans to South Korea, bailed out by the IMF in 1998, than to Switzerland. In 1998, ""Basel 2"" was proposed, using much more sophisticated risk classifications. However, controversy over these new classifications, and the cost to banks of administering the new approach, led to the introduction of Basel 2 being delayed until (at least) 2005."
Basis point,"One one-hundredth of a percentage point. Small movements in the interest rate, the exchange rate and bond yields are often described in terms of basis points. If a bond yield moves from 5.25% to 5.45%, it has risen by 20 basis points."
Bear,"An investor who thinks that the price of a particular security or class of securities (shares, say) is going to fall; the opposite of a bull."
Behavioural economics,"A branch of economics that concentrates on explaining the economic decisions people make in practice, especially when these conflict with what conventional economic theory predicts they will do. Behaviourists try to augment or replace traditional ideas of economic rationality (homo economicus) with decision-making models borrowed from psychology. According to psychologists, people are disproportionately influenced by a fear of feeling regret and will often forgo benefits even to avoid only a small risk of feeling they have failed. They are also prone to cognitive dissonance, often holding on to a belief plainly at odds with new evidence, usually because the belief has been held and cherished for a long time. Then there is anchoring: people are often overly influenced by outside suggestion. People apparently also suffer from status quo bias: they are willing to take bigger gambles to maintain the status quo than they would be to acquire it in the first place."
Big Mac index,"The Big Mac index was devised by Pam Woodall of The Economist in 1986, as a light-hearted guide to whether currencies are at their ""correct"" level. It is based on one of the oldest concepts in international economics, purchasing power parity (PPP), the notion that a dollar, say, should buy the same amount in all countries. In the long run, argue ppp fans, currencies should move towards the exchange rate, which equalises the prices of an identical basket of goods and services in each country. In this case, the basket is a McDonalds' Big Mac, which is produced in more than 100 countries. The Big Mac PPP is the exchange rate that would leave hamburgers costing the same in the United States as elsewhere. Comparing actual exchange rates with PPP signals whether a currency is undervalued or overvalued. Some studies have found that the Big Mac index is often a better predictor of currency movements than more theoretically rigorous models."
Black economy,"If you pay your cleaner or builder in cash, or for some reason neglect to tell the taxman that you were paid for a service rendered, you participate in the black or underground economy. Such transactions do not normally show up in the figures for GDP, so the black economy may mean that a country is much richer than the official data suggest. In the United States and the UK, the black economy adds an estimated 5-10% to GDP; in Italy, it may add 30%. As for Russia, in the late 1990s estimates of the black economy ranged as high as 50% of GDP."
Black-Scholes,"A formula for pricing financial options. Its invention allowed a previously undreamed of precision in the pricing of options (which had hitherto been done using crude rules of thumb), and probably made possible the explosive growth in the markets for options and other derivatives that took place after the formula became widely used in the early 1970s. Myron Scholes and Robert Merton were awarded the nobel prize for economics for their part in devising the formula; their co-inventor, Fischer Black (1938-95), was ineligible, having died."
Boom and bust,See business cycle.
Bounded rationality,"A theory of human decision making that assumes that people behave rationally, but only within the limits of the information available to them. Because their information may be inadequate (bounded) they make take decisions that appear to be irrational according to traditional theories about homo economicus (economic man). (See also behavioural economics.)"
Bretton Woods,"A conference held at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in 1944, which designed the structure of the international monetary system after the second world war and set up the imf and the world bank. It was agreed that the exchange rates of IMF members would be pegged to the dollar, with a maximum variation of 1% either side of the agreed rate. Rates could be adjusted more sharply only if a country's balance of payments was in fundamental disequilibrium. In August 1971 economic troubles and the cost of financing the Vietnam war led the American president, Richard Nixon, to devalue the dollar. This shattered confidence in the fixed exchange rate system and by 1973 all of the main currencies were floating freely, at rates set mostly by market forces rather than government fiat."
Business confidence,"How the people who run companies feel about their organisations' prospects. In many countries, surveys measure average business confidence. These can provide useful signs about the current condition of the economy, because companies often have information about consumer demand sooner than government statisticians do."
Business cycle,"Boom and bust. The long-run pattern of economic growth and recession. According to the Centre for International Business Cycle Research at Columbia University, between 1854 and 1945 the average expansion lasted 29 months and the average contraction 21 months. Since the second world war, however, expansions have lasted almost twice as long, an average of 50 months, and contractions have shortened to an average of only 11 months. Over the years, economists have produced numerous theories of why economic activity fluctuates so much, none of them particularly convincing. A Kitchin cycle supposedly lasted 39 months and was due to fluctuations in companies' inventories. The Juglar cycle would last 8-9 years as a result of changes in investment in plant and machinery. Then there was the 20-year Kuznets cycle, allegedly driven by house-building, and, perhaps the best-known theory of them all, the 50-year kondratieff wave.  hayek tangled with keynes over what caused the business cycle, and won the nobel prize for economics for his theory that variations in an economy's output depended on the sort of capital it had. Taking a quite different tack, in the late 1960s Arthur Okun, an economic adviser to presidents Kennedy and Johnson, proclaimed that the business cycle was ""obsolete"". A year later, the American economy was in recession. Again, in the late 1990s, some economists claimed that technological innovation and globalisation meant that the business cycle was a thing of the past. Alas, they were soon proved wrong."
Buyer's market,A market in which supply seems plentiful and prices seem low; the opposite of a seller's market.
Cannibalise,"Eating people is wrong. Eating your own business may not be. FIRMS used to be reluctant to launch new products and SERVICES that competed with what they were already doing, as the new thing would eat into (cannibalise) their existing business. In today's innovative, technology-intensive economy, however, a willingness to cannibalise is more often seen as a good thing. This is because INNOVATION often takes the form of what economists call creative destruction (see SCHUMPETER), in which a superior new product destroys the market for existing products. In this environment, the best course of action for successful firms that want to avoid losing their market to a rival with an innovation may be to carry out the creative destruction themselves."
Capacity,"The amount a company or an economy can produce using its current equipment, workers, CAPITAL and other resources at full tilt. Judging how close an economy is to operating at full capacity is an important ingredient of MONETARY POLICY, for if there is not enough spare capacity to absorb an increase in DEMAND,   PRICES are likely to rise instead. Measuring an economy's OUTPUT GAP - how far current OUTPUT is above or below what it would be at full capacity - is difficult, if not impossible, which is why even the best-intentioned CENTRAL BANK can struggle to keep down INFLATION. When there is too much spare capacity, however, the result can be DEFLATION, as FIRMS and employees cut their prices and wage demands to compete for whatever demand there may be."
Capital adequacy ratio,"The ratio of a BANK’s CAPITAL to its total ASSETS, required by regulators to be above a minimum (“adequate”) level so that there is little RISK of the bank going bust. How high this minimum level is may vary according to how risky a bank’s activities are."
Capital asset pricing model,"A method of valuing ASSETS and calculating the COST OF CAPITAL (for an alternative, see ARBITRAGE PRICING THEORY). The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) has come to dominate modern finance."
Capital controls,"government-imposed restrictions on the ability of CAPITAL to move in or out of a country. Examples include limits on foreign INVESTMENT in a country's FINANCIAL MARKETS, on direct investment by foreigners in businesses or property, and on domestic residents' investments abroad. Until the 20th century capital controls were uncommon, but many countries then imposed them. Following the end of the second world war only Switzerland, Canada and the United States adopted open capital regimes. Other rich countries maintained strict controls and many made them tougher during the 1960s and 1970s. This changed in the 1980s and early 1990s, when most developed countries scrapped their capital controls."
Capital flight,"When CAPITAL flows rapidly out of a country, usually because something happens which causes investors suddenly to lose confidence in its economy. (Strictly speaking, the problem is not so much the MONEY leaving, but rather that investors in general suddenly lower their valuation of all the assets of the country.) This is particularly worrying when the flight capital belongs to the country’s own citizens. This is often associated with a sharp fall in the EXCHANGE RATE of the abandoned country’s currency."
Capital intensive,A production process that involves comparatively large amounts of CAPITAL; the opposite of LABOUR INTENSIVE.
Capital structure,"The composition of a company’s mixture of DEBT and EQUITY financing. A firm’s debt-equity ratio is often referred to as its GEARING. Taking on more debt is known as gearing up, or increasing lever age. In the 1960s, Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller (1923–2000) published a series of articles arguing that it did not matter whether a company financed its activities by issuing debt, or equity, or a mixture of the two. (For this they were awarded the NOBEL PRIZE FOR ECONOMICS.) But, they said, this rule does not apply if one source of financing is treated more favourably by the taxman than another. In the United States, debt has long had tax advantages over equity, so their theory implies that American FIRMS should finance themselves with debt. Companies also finance themselves by using the PROFIT they retain after paying dividends."
CAPM,See CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL.
Catch-up effect,"In any period, the economies of countries that start off poor generally grow faster than the economies of countries that start off rich. As a result, the NATIONAL INCOME of poor countries usually catches up with the national income of rich countries. New technology may even allow DEVELOPING COUNTRIES  to leap-frog over industrialised countries with older technology. This, at least, is the traditional economic theory. In recent years, there has been considerable debate about the extent and speed of convergence in reality."
Ceteris paribus,"Other things being equal. Economists use this Latin phrase to cover their backs. For example, they might say that “higher interest rates will lead to lower inflation, ceteris paribus”, which means that they will stand by their prediction about INFLATION only if nothing else changes apart from the rise in the INTEREST   RATE."
Charity,"“Bah! Humbug”, was Scrooge’s opinion of charitable giving. Some economists reckon charity goes against economic rationality. Some have argued that the popularity of charitable giving is proof that people are not economically rational. Others argue that it shows that ALTRUISM is something that people get pleasure (UTILITY) from, and so are willing to spend some of their INCOME on it. An interesting question is the extent to which the state is competing with private charity when it redistributes money from rich to poor or spends more on health care and whether this is inefficient."
Chicago School,"A fervently free-market economic philosophy long associated with the University of Chicago. At times, especially when KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS was the orthodoxy in much of the world, the Chicago School was regarded as a bastion of unworldly extremism. However, from the late 1970s it came to be regarded as mainstream by many and Chicago trained economists often played a crucial part in the implementation of policies of low INFLATION  and market LIBERALISATION that swept the world during the 1980s and 1990s. By 2003, boasted the University of Chicago, some 22 of the 49 then winners of the NOBEL PRIZE FOR ECONOMICS had been faculty members, students or researchers there."
Classical dichotomy,See MONETARY NEUTRALITY.
Classical economics,"The dominant theory of economics from the 18th century to the 20th century, when it evolved into NEO-CLASSICAL ECONOMICS. Classical economists, who included Adam SMITH, David RICARDO and John Stuart Mill, believed that the pursuit of individual self-interest produced the greatest possible economic benefits for society as a whole through the power of the INVISIBLE HAND. They also believed that an economy is always in EQUILIBRIUM or moving towards it."
Coase theorem,See EXTERNALITY.
Commoditisation,"The process of becoming a COMMODITY. Micro­chips, for example, started out as a specialised technical innovation, costing a lot and earning their makers a high PROFIT on each chip. Now chips are largely homogeneous: the same chip can be used for many things, and any manufacturer willing to invest in some fairly standardised equip ment can make them. As a result, COMPETITION is fierce and PRICES and profit margins are low. Some economists argue that in today's economy the faster pace of innovation will make the process of commoditisation increasingly common."
Common goods,See TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS.
Comparative advantage,"Paul Samuelson, one of the 20th century's greatest economists, once remarked that the principle of comparative advantage was the only big idea that ECONOMICS had produced that was both true and surprising. It is also one of the oldest theories in economics, usually ascribed to DAVID RICARDO. The theory underpins the economic case for FREE TRADE. But it is often misunderstood or misrepresented by opponents of free trade. It shows how countries can gain from trading with each other even if one of them is more efficient - it has an ABSOLUTE ADVANTAGE - in every sort of economic activity. Comparative advantage is about identifying which activities a country (or firm or individual) is most efficient at doing."
Competition,"The more competition there is, the more likely are FIRMS to be efficient and PRICES to be low. Economists have identified several different sorts of competition. PERFECT COMPETITION is the most competitive market imaginable in which everybody is a price taker. Firms earn only normal profits, the bare minimum PROFIT necessary to keep them in business. If firms earn more than this (excess profits) other firms will enter the market and drive the price level down until there are only normal profits to be made."
Competitive advantage,Something that gives a firm (or a person or a country) an edge over its rivals.
Competitiveness,"Real economists don't talk about competitiveness,' said Paul Krugman, a much-respected contemporary economist. Real businessmen and real politicians talk about it all the time, however. Many FIRMS have undergone savage downsizing to remain competitive, and governments have set up numerous committees to examine how to sharpen their countries' economic performance."
Complementary goods,"When you buy a computer, you will also need to buy software. Computer hardware and software are therefore complementary goods: two products, for which an increase (or fall) in DEMAND for one leads to an increase (fall) in demand for the other. Complements are the opposite of SUBSTITUTE GOODS. For instance, Microsoft Windows-based  personal computers and Apple Macs are substitutes."
Compound interest,"If a deposit account of $100 earns an INTEREST RATE of 10% a year, then at the end of the year the account will contain $110. If all of that money is left in the account, then the 10% interest will be paid on the $110, so at the end of the second year $11 of interest will be added, making $121 in all. This is known as compound interest. By contrast, SIMPLE INTEREST pays the 10% only on the original sum in the account."
Concentration,"The tendency of a market to be dominated by a few big FIRMS. A high degree of concentration may be evidence of ANTITRUST problems, if it reflects a lack of COMPETITION. Traditionally, economists examined whether there was too much concentration using the HERFINDAHL-HIRSCHMAN INDEX, which is determined by adding the squares of the market shares of all firms involved. A low Herfindahl indicated many competitors and thus great difficulty in exercising MARKET POWER; a high Herfindahl, however, suggested a concentrated market in which PRICE rises are easier to sustain. More recently, antitrust authorities have placed less emphasis on concentration. One reason is that it is hard to define the market in which concentration should be measured. Instead, antitrust authorities have turned their attention to finding examples of firms earning excessive profits or holding back INNOVATION, although this too raises tricky conceptual and practical questions."
Conditionality,"When there are strings attached, for example, to INTERNATIONAL AID or loans from the IMF or WORLD BANK. The delivery of the MONEY may be made subject to the GOVERNMENT of the country implementing economic or political reforms desired by the donor or lender."
Consumer confidence,"How good consumers feel about their economic prospects. Measures of average consumer confidence can be a useful, though not infallible, indicators of how much consumers are likely to spend. Combined with measures such as business confidence, it can shed light on overall levels of economic activity."
Consumer prices,"What people are usually thinking of when they worry about INFLATION. The PRICES paid by whoever finally consumes goods or SERVICES, as opposed to prices paid by FIRMS at various stages of the production process (see, for example, FACTORY PRICES)."
Consumer surplus,"The difference between what a consumer would be willing to pay for a good or service and what that consumer actually has to pay. Added to PRODUCER SURPLUS, it provides a measure of the total economic benefit of a sale."
Contagion,"The domino effect, such as when economic problems in one country spread to another. (See Asian crisis.)"
Contestable market,"A market in which an inefficient firm, or one earning excess profits, is likely to be driven out by a more efficient or less profitable rival. A market can be contestable even if it is dominated by a single firm, which appears to enjoy a MONOPOLY with MARKET POWER, and the new entrant exists only as potential COMPETITION (see ANTITRUST)."
Convergence,See CATCH-UP EFFECT and DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
Corruption,"Being corrupt is not just bad for the soul, it also harms the economy. Research has found that in countries with a lot of corruption, less of their GDP goes into INVESTMENT and they have lower GROWTH rates. Corrupt countries invest less in education, a sector of the economy that pays big economic dividends but small bribes, than do clean countries, thereby reducing their HUMAN CAPITAL. They also attract less FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT."
Cost of capital,"The amount a firm must pay the owners of CAPITAL for the privilege of using it. This includes INTEREST payments on corporate DEBT, as well as the dividends generated for shareholders. In deciding whether to proceed with a project, FIRMS should calculate whether the project is likely to generate sufficient revenue to cover all the costs incurred, including the cost of capital. Calculating the cost of EQUITY capital can be tricky (see CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL and BETA)."
Cost-benefit analysis,"A method of reaching economic decisions by comparing the costs of doing something with its benefits. It sounds simple and common-sensical, but, in practice, it can easily become complicated and is much abused. With careful selection of the assumptions used in cost-benefit analysis it can be made to support, or oppose, almost anything. This is particularly so when the decision being con templated involves some cost or benefit for which there is no market PRICE or which, because of an EXTERNALITY, is not fully reflected in the market price. Typical examples would be a project to build a hydroelectric dam in an area of outstanding natural beauty or a law to require factories to limit emissions of gases that may cause ill-health. (See SHADOW PRICE.)"
Creative destruction,See SCHUMPETER.
Credit creation,"Making loans. Often the amount of credit creation is subject to REGULATION. Lenders may have limits on the amount of loans they can make relative to the ASSETS they have, so that they run little RISK of BANKRUPTCY (see Basel 1 and 2 and CAPITAL ADEQUACY RATIO). A CENTRAL BANK tries to keep the amount of credit creation below the level at which it would increase the MONEY SUPPLY so much that INFLATION accelerates. This was never easy to get right even when most lending was by BANKS, but it has become much harder with the recent growth of non-bank lending, such as by credit-card com­panies and retailers. Missing text"
Credit crunch,"When BANKS suddenly stop lending, or BOND market LIQUIDITY evaporates, usually because creditors have become extremely RISK AVERSE."
Crony capitalism,"An approach to business based on looking after yourself by looking out for your own. At least until the crisis of the late 1990s, some Asian companies, and even governments, were notable for awarding contracts only to family and friends. This was often a form of CORRUPTION, resulting in economic inefficiency."
Crowding out,"When the state does something it may discourage, or crowd out, private-sector attempts to do the same thing. At times, excessive GOVERNMENT borrowing has been blamed for low private-sector borrowing and, consequently, low INVESTMENT and (because the economic returns on public borrowing are typically lower than those on private DEBT, especially corporate debt) slower economic GROWTH. This has become less of a concern in recent years as government indebtedness has declined and, because of GLOBALISATION, FIRMS have become more able to raise CAPITAL outside their home country. Crowding out may also come from state spending on things that might be provided more efficiently by the private sector, such as health care, or even through CHARITY, redistribution."
Currency board,"A means by which some countries try to defend their currency from speculative attack. A country that introduces a currency board commits itself to converting its domestic currency on demand at a fixed EXCHANGE RATE. To make this commit ment credible, the currency board holds RESERVES of foreign currency (or GOLD or some other liquid ASSET) equal at the fixed rate of exchange to at least 100% of the value of the domestic currency that is issued."
Currency peg,When a GOVERNMENT announces that the EXCHANGE RATE of its currency is fixed against another currency or currencies. (See also CURRENCY BOARD.)
"De Soto, Hernando","A Peruvian economist who advocates establishing formal property rights for the poor to help them rapidly escape from poverty. In books such as The Other Path and The Mystery of Capital, he argued that, in developing countries, capitalism will thrive in the long run only if legal systems change so that most of the people feel that the law is on their side. One of the best ways to achieve this is to give full legal protection to the de facto property rights that are observed informally by the poor, such as when a community recognises that a certain family is entitled to occupy a particular piece of land."
Deadweight cost/loss,"The extent to which the value and impact of a tax, tax relief or SUBSIDY is reduced because of its side-effects. For instance, increasing the amount of tax levied on workers’ pay will lead some workers to stop working or work less, so reducing the amount of extra tax to be collected. However, creating a tax relief or subsidy to encourage people to buy life insurance would have a deadweight cost because people who would have bought insurance anyway would benefit."
Debt forgiveness,"Cancelling or rescheduling a borrower's debts to lessen the pain of the DEBT burden. Debt forgiveness is increasingly viewed as the best way to relieve the financial problems facing poorer countries. Some of these countries have to pay so much in INTEREST each year to foreign lenders that they  have little MONEY left to spend on the long-term solutions to their POVERTY, such as educating their workers and building a modern INFRASTRUCTURE. In 1998 the WORLD BANK calculated that around 40 of the world's poorest countries had an 'unsustainably high' debt burden: the present value of their total debts was more than 220% of their EXPORTS."
Debt-equity ratio,See CAPITAL STRUCTURE.
Deposit insurance,"Protection for your SAVINGS, in case your BANK goes Bust. Arrangements vary around the world, but in most countries deposit insurance is required by the GOVERNMENT and paid for by banks (and, ultimately, their customers), which contribute a small slice of their ASSETS to a central, usually government-run, insurance fund. If a bank defaults, this fund guarantees its customers' deposits, at least up to a certain amount. By reassuring banks' customers that their cash is protected, deposit insurance aims to prevent them from panicking and causing a bank run, and thereby reduces SYSTEMIC RISK. The United States introduced it in 1933, after a massive bank panic led to widespread BANKRUPTCY, deepening its DEPRESSION."
Derivatives,"Financial ASSETS that 'derive' their value from other assets. For example, an option to buy a SHARE is derived from the share. Some politicians and others responsible for financial REGULATION blame the growing use of derivatives for increasing VOLATILITY in asset PRICES, and for being a source of danger to their users. Economists mostly regard derivatives as a good thing, allowing more precise pricing of financial RISK and better RISK MANAGEMENT. However, they concede that when derivatives are misused the LEVERAGE that is often an integral part of them can have devastating consequences. So they come with an economists' health warning: if you don't understand it, don't use it."
Developing countries,"A euphemism for the world's poor countries, also known, often optimistically, as emerging economies. Some four-fifths of the world's 6 billion people already live in developing countries, many of them in abject POVERTY. Developing countries  account for less than one-fifth of total world GDP."
Development economics,"Spawned by the end of the colonial era in the 1950s and 1960s, a whole branch of economic theory grew up around the question of how to promote economic development in poor countries. The proposition on which development economics was built was that poor countries were intrinsically different from rich ones and so needed their own set of economic models. Some development economists argued, for instance, that the self-interested, rational individual (HOMO ECONOMICUS) did not exist in traditional tribal societies. They claimed that because many poor countries had large agricultural populations and were often dependent on a few COMMODITY EXPORTS for foreign exchange earnings, economic policies that suited rich countries would not work for them. With hindsight, much of this was misguided, and policies based on it had disastrous effects. Development economists believed that the state had to play a big role in fostering modernisation. Instead, the result was huge, inefficient ­bureaucracies riddled with CORRUPTION, massive BUDGET deficits and rampant INFLATION. During the 1990s, most governments of DEVELOPING COUNTRIES started to reverse these policies and undo the damage they had done by introducing policies based on similar economic models to those that had worked in rich countries. However, the sequencing of these new policies seemed to make a big difference to how well they worked.  Doing the right things in the right order is crucial."
Diminishing returns,"The more you have, the smaller is the extra benefit you get from having even more; also known as diseconomies of scale (see ECONOMIES OF SCALE). For instance, when workers have a lot of CAPITAL giving them a little more may not increase their PRODUCTIVITY anywhere near as much as would giving the same amount to workers who currently have little or no capital. This underpins the CATCH-UP      EFFECT, whereby there is (supposedly) convergence between the rates of GROWTH of DEVELOPING COUNTRIES and developed ones. In the NEW ECONOMY, some economists argue, capital may not suffer from diminishing returns, or at least the amount of diminishing will be much smaller. There may even be ever increasing returns."
Direct taxation,"Taxes levied on the INCOME or wealth of an individual or company. Contrast with INDIRECT TAXATION. In much of the world, direct tax rates fell during the 1980s and 1990s, partly because some economists argued that high rates of tax on income discouraged people from working, and that high rates of tax on PROFIT encouraged companies to move to countries with lower rates. Furthermore, high rates of INCOME TAX were viewed as politically unpopular. Even so, although rates were cut, because both personal income and corporate profits grew steadily throughout this period the total amount collected via direct taxation continued to rise. Economists often disagree about which of direct taxes or indirect taxes are the least inefficient method of taxation."
Discounted cashflow,"How much less is a sum of MONEY due in the future worth today? The answer is found by ­discounting the future cashflow, using an INTEREST RATE that reflects the fact that money in future is worth less than money now, because money now could be invested and earn INTEREST, whereas future money cannot. FIRMS use discounted cashflow to judge whether an INVESTMENT project is worthwhile. The interest rate is a means of reflecting the OPPORTUNITY COST of tying up money in the investment project. To test whether an investment makes economic sense the INCOME must be discounted so that it can be measured against the costs. If the present value of the benefits exceeds the costs, the investment is a good one."
Diseconomies of scale,See ECONOMIES OF SCALE.
Division of labour,People are better off specialising than trying to be jacks of all trades and ending up masters of none. The logic of dividing the workforce into different crafts and professions is the same as that underpinning the case for FREE TRADE: everybody benefits from doing those things in which they have a COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE and using INCOME from doing so to meet their other needs.
Dollarisation,"When a country's own MONEY is replaced as its citizens' preferred currency by the US dollar. This can be a deliberate GOVERNMENT policy or the result of many private choices by buyers and sellers (for instance, at the first sign of trouble, investors across Latin America generally flee into dollars). When it is government policy, dollarisation is, in essence, a beefed up CURRENCY _x0001__x0001__x0001__x0001__x0001_BOARD."
Dominant firm,"A firm with the ability to set PRICES in its market (see MONOPOLY, OLIGOPOLY and ANTITRUST)."
ECB,See EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK.
Economic and monetary union,"In January 1999, 11 of the 15 countries in the EUROPEAN UNION merged their national currencies into a single European currency, the EURO. This decision was motivated partly by politics and partly by hoped-for economic benefits from the creation of a single, integrated European economy. These benefits included currency stability and low INFLATION, underwritten by an independent EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK (a particular boon for countries with poor inflation records, such as Italy and Spain, but less so for traditionally low-inflation Germany). Furthermore, European businesses and individuals stood to save from handling one currency rather than many. Comparing PRICES and WAGES across the euro zone became easier, increasing COMPETITION by making it easier for companies to sell throughout the euro-zone and for consumers to shop around."
Economic indicator,"A statistic used for judging the health of an economy, such as GDP per head, the rate of UNEMPLOYMENT or the rate of INFLATION. Such statistics are often subject to huge revisions in the months and years after they are first published, thus causing difficulties and embarrassment for the economic policymakers who rely on them."
Economic man,"At the heart of economic theory is homo economicus, the economist's model of human behaviour. In traditional CLASSICAL ECONOMICS and in NEO-CLASSICAL ECONOMICS it was assumed that people acted in their own self-interest. Adam SMITH argued that society was made better off by everybody pursuing their selfish interests through the workings of the INVISIBLE HAND. However, in recent years, mainstream economists have tried to include a broader range of human motivations in their models. There have been attempts to model ALTRUISM and CHARITY. BEHAVIOURAL ECONOMICS has drawn on psychological insights into human behaviour to explain economic phenomena."
Economic sanctions,"A way of punishing errant countries, which is currently more acceptable than bombing or invading  them. One or more restrictions are imposed on international trade with the targeted country in order to persuade the target's GOVERNMENT to change a policy. Possible sanctions include limiting export or import trade with the target; constraining INVESTMENT in the target; and preventing TRANSFERS of MONEY involving citizens or the government of the target. Sanctions can be multi­lateral, with many countries acting together, perhaps under the auspices of the United Nations, or unilateral, when one country takes action on its own."
Effective exchange rate,See TRADE-WEIGHTED EXCHANGE RATE.
Efficiency wages,WAGES that are set at above the market clearing rate so as to encourage workers to increase their PRODUCTIVITY.
Efficient market hypothesis,"You can't beat the market. The efficient market hypothesis says that the PRICE of a financial ASSET reflects all the INFORMATION available and responds only to unexpected news. Thus prices can be regarded as optimal estimates of true investment value at all times. It is impossible for investors to predict whether the price will move up or down (future price movements are likely to follow a RANDOM WALK), so on AVERAGE an investor is unlikely to beat the market. This belief underpins ­ARBITRAGE PRICING THEORY, the CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL and concepts such as BETA."
Emerging markets,See DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
Endogenous,Inside the economic model; the opposite of EXOGENOUS (see also GROWTH).
Engel's law,"People generally spend a smaller share of their BUDGET on food as their INCOME rises. Ernst Engel, a Russian statistician, first made this observation in 1857. The reason is that food is a necessity, which poor people have to buy. As people get richer they can afford better-quality food, so their food spending may increase, but they can also afford LUXURIES beyond the budgets of poor people. Hence the share of food in total spending falls as incomes grow."
Environmental economics,"Some people think CAPITALISM is wholly bad for the environment as it is based on consuming scarce resources. They want less CONSUMPTION and greater reliance on renewable resources. They oppose FREE TRADE because they favour self-sufficiency (AUTARKY), or at least so-called FAIR TRADE, and because they believe it encourages poorer countries to destroy their natural resources in order to get rich quick. Although few professional economists would share these views, in recent years many attempts have been made to incorporate environmental concerns within mainstream economics."
Equity risk premium,"The extra reward investors get for buying a SHARE over what they get for holding a less risky ASSET, such as a government BOND. Modern financial theory assumes that the premium will be just big enough on AVERAGE to compensate the investor for the extra RISK. However, studies have found that the average equity premium over many years has been much larger than appears to be justified by the average riskiness of shares. To solve this so-called equity premium puzzle, some economists have suggested that investors may have greater risk aversion towards shares than traditional theory assumes. Some claim that the past equity premium was mismeasured, or reflected an unrepresentative sample of share PRICES. Others suggest that the high premium is evidence that the EFFICIENT MARKET HYPOTHESIS does not apply to the stockmarket. Some economists think that the premium fell to more easily explained levels during the 1990s. Nobody really knows which, if any, of these interpretations is right."
Euro Zone,The economy comprising all the countries that have adopted the euro. There is much debate among economists about whether the euro zone is in fact an optimal currency area.
European Central Bank,"The CENTRAL BANK of the EUROPEAN UNION, responsible since January 1999 for setting the official short-term INTEREST RATE in countries using the EURO as their domestic currency. In this role, the European Central Bank (ECB) replaced national central banks such as Germany's Bundesbank, which became local branches of the ECB."
Evolutionary economics,"A Darwinian approach to ECONOMICS, sometimes called institutional economics. Following the tradition of SCHUMPETER, it views the economy as an evolving system and places a strong emphasis on dynamics, changing structures (including technologies, institutions, beliefs and behaviour) and DISEQUILIBRIUM processes (such as INNOVATION, selection and imitation)."
Excess returns,"Getting more money from an economic INVESTMENT than you needed to justify investing. In PERFECT COMPETITION, the FACTORS OF PRODUCTION earn only normal RETURNS, that is, the minimum amount of WAGES, PROFIT, INTEREST or RENT needed to secure their use in the economic activity in question, rather than in an alternative. Excess returns can only be earned for more than a short period when there is MARKET FAILURE, especially MONOPOLY, because otherwise the existence of excess returns would quickly attract COMPETITION, which would drive down returns until they were normal."
Exchange controls,"Limits on the amount of foreign currency that can be taken into a country, or of domestic currency that can be taken abroad."
Exogenous,"Outside the model. For instance, in traditional NEO-CLASSICAL ECONOMICS, models of GROWTH rely on an exogenous factor. To keep growing, an eco­nomy needs continual infusions of technological progress. Yet this is a force that the neo-classical model makes no attempt to explain. The rate of technological progress comes from outside the model; it is simply assumed by the economic modellers. In other words, it is exogenous. New growth theory tries to calculate the rate of technological progress inside the economic model by mapping its relationship to factors such as HUMAN CAPITAL, free markets, COMPETITION and GOVERNMENT expenditure. Thus, in these models, growth is ­ENDOGENOUS."
Expected returns,"The CAPITAL GAIN plus INCOME that investors think they will earn by making an INVESTMENT, at the time they invest."
Expenditure tax,"A tax on what people spend, rather than what they earn or their wealth. Economists often regard it as more efficient than other taxes because it may discourage productive economic activity less; it is not the creating of INCOME and wealth that is taxed, but the spending of it. It can be a form of INDIRECT TAXATION, added to the PRICE of a good or service when it is sold, or DIRECT TAXATION, levied on people's income minus their SAVINGS over a year."
Export credit,"Loans to boost EXPORTS. In many countries these are subsidised by a GOVERNMENT keen to encourage exports. Typically, the CREDIT comes in two forms: loans to foreign buyers of domestic produce; and guarantees on loans made by BANKS to domestic companies so they can produce the exports that should pay off the loan. This effectively insures producers against non-payment. When governments compete aggressively with export credits to win business for domestic FIRMS the sums involved can become large. The economic benefit of export credits is unclear at the best of times. This may be because they are largely motivated by political goals."
Factor cost,"A measure of OUTPUT reflecting the costs of the factors of production used, rather than market prices, which may differ because of indirect tax and subsidy (see gdp)."
Factors of production,"The ingredients of economic activity: land, labour, capital and enterprise."
Factory prices,"The prices charged by producers to wholesalers and retailers. Because these prices are eventually passed on to the end customer, changes in factory prices, also known as producer prices, can be a leading indicator of consumer price inflation."
Fair trade,"Many politicians and NGOs argue that free trade is not enough; it should also be fair. On the face of it, fairness is self-evidently a good thing. However, fairness, in trade as in beauty, lies in the eye of the beholder. Frederic Bastiat, a 19th-century French satirist, once observed that the sun offered unfair competition to candle makers. If windows could be boarded up during the day, he argued, more jobs could be created making candles. American trade unions complain that Mexicans' lower wages, say, give them an unfair advantage. Mexicans say they cannot compete fairly against more productive American counterparts. Both sides are wrong. Mexicans are paid less than Americans largely because they are, in general, less productive. There is nothing unfair about that; indeed, it helps to make trade mutually beneficial. The mutual benefits of trade also disprove the fair traders' other complaint, that free trade harms poor countries. (See comparative advantage.)"
FDI,See foreign direct investment.
Financial centre,"A place in which an above-average amount of financial business takes place. The big ones are New York, London, Tokyo and Frankfurt. Small ones such as Dublin, Bermuda, Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands also play an important part in the global financial system. globalisation and the increase in electronic trading has raised concerns about whether there will be as much need for financial centres in the 21st century as there was in the 19th and 20th centuries. So far, the evidence suggests that the biggest, at least, will remain important."
Financial instrument,"Certificate of ownership of a financial asset, such as a bond or a share."
Financial intermediary,A middleman. An individual or institution that brings together investors (the source of funds) and users of funds (such as borrowers). May be increasingly at risk of disintermediation.
Financial markets,See capital markets and money markets.
Fine tuning,"A favourite government policy in the keynesian-dominated 1950s and 1960s, involving frequent adjustments to fiscal policy and/or monetary policy to alter the level of demand to keep the economy growing at a steady rate. The trouble was and is, partly because of the inadequacies of economic forecasting, that these frequent adjustments were and are often mistaken, making the economy's growth path more, rather than less, erratic. In the 1990s, fine tuning was increasingly shunned by central banks and governments, which stopped trying to manage short-term demand and instead aimed to pursue long-term macroeconomic goals, which required fewer adjustments to policy. Or so they claimed. In practice, there continued to be some attempted fine tuning."
First-mover advantage,"The early bird gets the worm. game theory shows that being the first to enter a market or to introduce an innovation can be a huge advantage, not just because the first firm in can erect barriers to entry, but also because potential rivals may be discouraged from committing the resources necessary to compete successfully. However, this advantage may sometimes be cancelled out by the benefits enjoyed by followers, such as the chance to avoid--and learn from--the mistakes made by the first mover. (See incumbent advantage.)"
Fiscal drag,"A nice little earner for the state. Fiscal drag is the tendency of revenue from taxation to rise as a share of GDP in a growing economy. Tax allowances, progressive tax rates and the threshold above which a particular rate of tax applies usually remain constant or are changed only gradually. By contrast, when the economy grows, income, spending and corporate profit rise. So the tax-take increases too, without any need for government action. This helps slow the rate of increase in demand, reducing the pace of growth, making it less likely to result in higher inflation. Thus fiscal drag is an automatic stabiliser, as it acts naturally to keep demand stable."
Fiscal neutrality,"When the net effect of taxation and public spending is neutral, neither stimulating nor dampening demand. The term can be used to describe the overall stance of fiscal policy: a balanced budget is neutral, as total tax revenue equals total public spending. It can also refer more narrowly to the combined impact of new measures introduced in an annual budget: the budget can be fiscally neutral if any new taxes equal any new spending, even if the overall stance of the budget either boosts or slows demand."
Fixed costs,"Production costs that do not change when the quantity of output produced changes, for instance, the cost of renting an office or factory space. Contrast with variable costs."
Foreign direct investment,"Investing directly in production in another country, either by buying a company there or establishing new operations of an existing business. This is done mostly by companies as opposed to financial institutions, which prefer indirect investment abroad such as buying small parcels of a country's supply of shares or bonds. Foreign direct investment (FDI) grew rapidly during the 1990s before slowing a bit, along with the global economy, in the early years of the 21st century. Most of this investment went from one oecd country to another, but the share going to developing countries, especially in Asia, increased steadily."
Forward contracts,See derivatives.
Free lunch,There's no such thing. See opportunity cost.
Free riding,"Getting the benefit of a good or service without paying for it, not necessarily illegally. This may be possible because certain types of goods and services are actually hard to charge for--a firework display, for instance. Another way to look at this may be that the good or service has a positive externality. However, there can sometimes be a free-rider problem, if the number of people willing to pay for the good or service is not enough to cover the cost of providing it. In this case, the good or service might not be produced, even though it would be beneficial for the economy as a whole to have it. public goods are often at risk of free riding; in their case, the problem can be overcome by financing the good by imposing a tax on the entire population."
Free trade,"The ability of people to undertake economic transactions with people in other countries free from any restraints imposed by governments or other regulators. Measured by the volume of imports and exports, world trade has become increasingly free in the years since the second world war. A fall in barriers to trade, as a result of the general agreement on tariffs and trade and its successor, the world trade organisation, has helped stimulate this growth. The volume of world merchandise trade at the start of the 21st century was about 17 times what it was in 1950, and the world's total output was not even six times as big.  The ratio of world exports to gdp had more than doubled since 1950. Of this, trade in manufactured goods was worth three times the value of trade in services, although the share of services trade was growing fast."
Frictional unemployment,"That part of the jobless total caused by people simply changing jobs and taking their time about it, because they are spending time on job search or are taking a break before starting with a new employer. There is likely to be some frictional unemployment even when there is technically full employment, because most people change jobs from time to time."
"Friedman, Milton","Loved and loathed; perhaps the most influential economist of his generation. He won the nobel prize for economics in 1976, one of many chicago school economists to receive that honour. He has been recognised for his achievements in the study of consumption, monetary history and theory, and for demonstrating how complex policies aimed at economic stabilisation can be."
Fungible,"You can't tell them apart. Something is fungible when any one single specimen is indistinguishable from any other. Somebody who is owed $1 does not care which particular dollar he gets. Anything that people want to use as money must be fungible, whether it be gold bars, beads or shells."
"G7, G8, G10, G21, G22, G26","I don't want to belong to any club that will accept me as a member, quipped Groucho Marx. But the world's politicians are desperate to join the economic clubs that are the Group of Seven (G7), G8, G10 and so on. Being a member shows that, economically speaking, your country matters. Alas, beyond making politicians feel good, there has not been much evidence in recent years that they do anything useful, apart from letting government officials and journalists talk to each other about economics and politics, usually in beautiful locations with lots of fine food and drink on hand."
Game theory,"How to win at Twister? No, but maybe at monopoly. Game theory is a technique for analysing how people, firms and governments should behave in strategic situations (in which they must interact with each other), and in deciding what to do must take into account what others are likely to do and how others might respond to what they do. For instance, competition between two firms can be analysed as a game in which firms play to achieve a long-term competitive advantage (perhaps even a monopoly). The theory helps each firm to develop its optimal strategy for, say, pricing its products and deciding how much to produce; it can help the firm to anticipate in advance what its competitor will do and shows how best to respond if the competitor does something unexpected. It is particularly useful for understanding behaviour in monopolistic competition."
GATT,See general agreement on tariffs and trade and world trade organisation.
GDP,"Gross domestic product, a measure of economic activity in a country. It is calculated by adding the total value of a country's annual output of goods and services. GDP = private consumption + investment + public spending + the change in inventories + (exports - imports). It is usually valued at market prices; by subtracting indirect tax and adding any government subsidy, however, GDP can be calculated at factor cost. This measure more accurately reveals the income paid to factors of production. Adding income earned by domestic residents from their investments abroad, and subtracting income paid from the country to investors abroad, gives the country's gross national product (GNP)."
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,"Or GATT, the vehicle for promoting international free trade, through a series of rounds of negotiations between the governments of trading countries. The first GATT round began in 1945. The last led to the establishment of the world trade organisation in 1995."
General equilibrium,"Economic perfection. This is when demand and supply are in balance (the market is in equilibrium) for each and every good and service in the economy. Nobody thinks that real-world economies can ever be that perfect; at best there is ""partial equilibrium"". But most economists think that general equilibrium is something worth aspiring to."
Generational accounting,"A relatively new way of analysing fiscal policy by identifying the financial costs and benefits of government policies to people of different ages, now living or yet to be born. Fiscal policy can distribute resources between different generations, sometimes deliberately and often inadvertently. At any moment in time, one generation may be in work and paying taxes that support other generations (those at school or retired) that are not working. Over its lifetime, one generation's mix of taxes paid and benefits received may differ sharply from that of another generation. Politicians are often tempted to ignore the needs of future generations (who, clearly, cannot vote at the time) in order to win the support of current generations, for instance by borrowing heavily to fund current spending. More fundamentally, because it incorporates all the tax and spending, current and future, to which a government is committed, generational accounting is a much better guide to whether fiscal policy is sustainable than measures such as the budget deficit, which looks only at taxes and spending in the current year."
Giffen goods,"Named after Robert Giffen (1837-1910), a good for which demand increases as its price rises. But such goods may not exist in the real world."
Gini coefficient,"An inequality indicator. The Gini coefficient measures the inequality of income distribution within a country. It varies from zero, which indicates perfect equality, with every household earning exactly the same, to one, which implies absolute inequality, with a single household earning a country's entire income. Latin America is the world's most unequal region, with a Gini coefficient of around 0.5; in rich countries the figure is closer to 0.3."
Global public goods,"Public goods that cannot be provided by one country acting alone but only by the joint efforts of many (strictly, all) countries. Some economists, along with global institutions such as the UN, reckon that such goods include international law and law enforcement, a stable global financial system, an open trading system, health, peace and enviromental sustainability."
Globalisation,"A buzz word that refers to the trend for people, firms and governments around the world to become increasingly dependent on and integrated with each other. This can be a source of tremendous opportunity, as new markets, workers, business partners, goods and services and jobs become available, but also of competitive threat, which may undermine economic activities that were viable before globalisation."
gni,"Short for gross national income, a term now used instead of gnp in national accounts."
Gold,"For much of human history gold has been an important ingredient of economic activity. But its importance declined during the 20th century and may continue to shrink in future. The gold standard, which fixed exchange rates to the value of gold during the 19th and early 20th centuries, has been long abandoned. central banks, which in 2000 still owned 30,000 tonnes, over one-quarter of all the gold ever mined, no longer feel the need to have large reserves of the metal to support the value of their currency. It does not pay them any interest, though they may earn a little by lending it to bullion dealers. So they have started to sell."
Golden rule,"Over the economic cycle, a government should borrow only to invest and not to finance current spending. This rule is certainly a prudent approach to fiscal policy, provided that governments are honest in describing spending as investment, that they invest in appropriate things and do so efficiently, and that they are careful to avoid crowding out superior private investment. But there are other fiscal policy options that may make as much sense. See, for example, balanced budget."
Government bonds,See bonds and gilts.
Government expenditure,"Spending by national and local government and some government-backed institutions. See fiscal policy, golden rule and budget."
Government revenue,See taxation.
"Greenspan, Alan","The most famous of all central bank bosses, so far. A former jazz musician turned economist, he became chairman of the board of governors of America's Federal Reserve in 1987, shortly before Wall Street crashed. In 2003, he was reappointed until 2005. He won admirers for delivering monetary policy that helped to bring down inflation and create the conditions for strong economic growth. Some people considered him the nearest thing capitalism had to God. In 1996, he famously wondered aloud whether rising share prices were the result of ""irrational exuberance"". Economists debate whether history will judge him a failure because he did not prevent the growth of a huge bubble in America's economy."
Gresham's law,"Bad money drives out good. One of the oldest laws in economics, named after Sir Thomas Gresham, an adviser to Queen Elizabeth I of England. He observed that when a currency has been debased and a new one is introduced to replace it, the new one will be hoarded and effectively taken out of circulation, while the old one will continue to be used for transactions, to be got rid of as fast as possible."
Gross domestic product,See gdp.
Gross national product,See gnp.
Growth,"What economic activity is all about, but how can it be made to happen? Economists have plenty of theories, but none of them has all the answers."
Hard currency,"MONEY you can trust. A hard currency is expected to retain its value, or even benefit from APPRECIATION, against softer currencies. This makes it a popular choice for people involved in international transactions. The dollar, D-MARK, sterling and the Swiss franc each became a hard currency, if only some of the time, during the 20th century."
"Hayek, Friedrich","An influential economist of the Austrian school, who won the NOBEL PRIZE FOR ECONOMICS in 1974 for his theory of the BUSINESS CYCLE many years after this body of work seemed to have been disproved by KEYNES. Born in 1899, Hayek attended his home-town University of Vienna after the first world war. He was attracted to SOCIALISM until he read a pioneering Austrian economist, Ludwig von Mises, on the subject, after which, he said, 'the world was never the same again'."
Hedge funds,"These bogey-men of the FINANCIAL MARKETS are often blamed, usually unfairly, when things go wrong. There is no simple definition of a hedge fund (few of them actually HEDGE). But they all aim to maximise their absolute returns rather than relative ones; that is, they concentrate on making as much MONEY as possible, not (like many mutual funds) simply on outperforming an index. Although they are often accused of disrupting financial markets by their SPECULATION, their willingness to bet against the herd of other investors may push security prices closer to their true fundamental values, not away."
Herfindahl-Hirschman index,"A warning signal of possible MONOPOLY. ANTITRUST economists often gauge the COMPETITIVENESS of an industry by measuring the extent to which its OUTPUT is concentrated among a few FIRMS. One such measure is a Herfindahl-Hirschman index. To calculate it, take the market share of each firm in the industry, square it, then add them all up. If there are 100 equal-sized firms (a market with close to PERFECT COMPETITION) the index is 100. If there are four equal-sized firms (possible OLIGOPOLY) it will be 2,500. The higher the Herfindahl number, the more concentrated is MARKET POWER."
Homo economicus,See ECONOMIC MAN.
Horizontal equity,One way to keep TAXATION fair. Horizontal equity means that people with a similar ability to pay taxes should pay the same amount. (See EQUITY and VERTICAL EQUITY.)
Hot money,"money that is held in one currency but is liable to switch to another currency at a moment’s notice in search of the highest available RETURNS, thereby causing the first currency’s EXCHANGE RATE to plummet. It is often used to describe the money invested in currency markets by speculators."
House prices,"When they go through the roof it is usually a warning sign that an economy is overheating. House prices often rise after INTEREST RATE reductions, which lower mortgage payments and thus give buyers the ability to fund a larger amount of borrowing and so offer a higher price for their new home. Strangely, people often regard house-price INFLATION as good news, even though it creates as many losers as gainers. They argue that rising house prices help to boost consumer confidence, and are part of the WEALTH EFFECT: as house prices rise, people feel wealthier and so spend more. However, against this must be set a negative wealth effect. An increase in house prices makes many people worse off, such as first-time buyers and anyone planning to trade up to a better property."
Human Development Index,"The 'good life' guide. Calculated since 1990 by the United Nations Development Programme, the Human Development Index quantifies a country's development in terms of such things as education, length of life and clean water, as well as INCOME. Since the mid-1970s, the quality of life for humans throughout the world has improved enormously overall. America's human development index rose by around one-tenth between 1975 and 2001, for example. More spectacularly, during the same period, China's rose by around 40% and Indonesia's by nearly 50%. Even so, in 2001, some 54 countries were poorer than in 1990, and in 34, mostly in Africa and the former Soviet Union, life expectancy had fallen, reversing an impressive long-term trend, largely because of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and crime. Some 21 countries had a lower overall human development index in 2003 than in 1990."
Hyper-inflation,"Very, very bad. Although people debate when, precisely, very rapid INFLATION turns into ­hyper-inflation (a 100% or more increase in PRICES a year, perhaps?) nobody questions that it wreaks huge economic damage. After the first world war, German prices at one point were rising at a rate of 23,000% a year before the country’s economic system collapsed, creating a political opportunity grasped by the Nazis. In former Yugoslavia in 1993, prices rose by around 20% a day. Typically, hyper-inflation quickly leads to a complete loss of confidence in a country’s currency, and causes people to search for other forms of MONEY that are a better store of value. These may include physical ASSETS, GOLD and foreign currency. Hyper-inflation might be easier to live with if it was stable, as people could plan on the basis that prices would rise at a fast but predictable rate. However, there are no examples of stable hyper-inflation, precisely because it occurs only when there is a crisis of confidence across the economy, with all the behavioural unpredictability this implies."
ILO,"Short for International Labour Organisation, founded in 1919 as part of the Treaty of Versailles, which created the League of Nations. In 1946, it became the first specialised agency of the UN. Based in Geneva, it formulates international LABOUR standards, setting out desired minimum rights for workers: freedom of association; the right to organise and engage in collective bargaining; equality of opportunity and treatment; and the abolition of forced labour. It also compiles international labour statistics. One reason for its formation was the hope that international labour standards would stop countries using lower standards to gain a COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. From the 1980s onwards, the ILO approach came under attack as attention turned to the costs of high labour standards, notably slower economic GROWTH. Universal minimum labour standards might also work against FREE TRADE. Imposing rich-country labour standards on poorer countries might help keep the rich rich and the poor poor."
IMF,"Short for International Monetary Fund, referee and, when the need arises, rescuer of the world's FINANCIAL SYSTEM. The IMF was set up in 1944 at BRETTON WOODS, along with the WORLD BANK, to supervise the newly established fixed EXCHANGE RATE system. After this fell apart in 1971-73, the IMF became more involved with its member countries' economic policies, doling out advice on FISCAL POLICY and MONETARY POLICY as well as microeconomic changes such as PRIVATISATION, of which it became a forceful advocate. In the 1980s, it played a leading part in sorting out the problems of DEVELOPING COUNTRIES' mounting DEBT. More recently, it has several times co-ordinated and helped to finance assistance to countries with a currency crisis."
Income tax,"A much-loathed method of TAXATION based on earnings. It was first collected in 1797 by the Dutch Batavian Republic. In the UK it was introduced in 1799 as a “temporary” measure to finance a war against Napoleon, abolished in 1816 and reintroduced, forever, in 1842. In most countries, people do not pay it until their INCOME exceeds a minimum threshold, and richer people pay a higher rate of income tax than poorer people. Since the 1980s, the unpopularity with voters of high rates of income tax and concern that high rates discourage valuable economic activity have led many governments to reduce income-tax rates. However, this has not necessarily reduced the amount of total revenue collected in income tax (see LAFFER CURVE). Nor do governments that have reduced income tax rates always cut other sorts of taxes; on the contrary, they have often increased them sharply to make up for any revenue lost as a result of lower rates of income tax."
Incumbent advantage,"The importance of being there already. FIRMS that are in a market can have a significant COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE over aspiring entrants to that market, for instance, through having the opportunity to erect barriers to entry. (See FIRST-MOVER ADVANTAGE.)"
Index numbers,"Economists love to compile indices aggregating lots of individual data, so they can analyse broad trends in the behaviour of an economy. INFLATION is measured by an index of consumer (retail) PRICES. There are indices of all sorts of things that are bought and sold of which perhaps the best known are share price indices like the Dow Jones Industrial Average or FTSE-100. The main challenges in compiling an index are what, exactly, to include in it and what weight to give the different things that are included. A particularly tricky question is how to change an index over time. Measures of inflation are based on the price of a basket of things bought by a typical consumer. As the quality and choice of products in the basket change over time, the inflation index ought to take this into account. How, exactly, is much debated."
Indirect taxation,"Taxes that do not come straight out of a person's pay packet or ASSETS, or out of company PROFIT. For example, a CONSUMPTION tax, such as VALUE-ADDED tax (see EXPENDITURE TAX). Contrast with DIRECT TAXATION, such as INCOME TAX. Indirect taxation has become increasingly popular with politicians because it may be less noticeable to people paying it than income tax and is harder to avoid paying."
Inelastic,"When the SUPPLY or DEMAND for something is insensitive to changes in another variable, such as PRICE. (See ELASTICITY.)"
Inequality,"Does economic GROWTH create more or less equality? Do unequal societies grow more or less slowly than equal ones? Economists have debated these questions for as long as anyone can remember. One problem is to agree which sort of inequality matters: equality of outcome (that is, INCOME) or of opportunity? Another is how then to measure it. Equality of opportunity, which, in theory, should make a difference to growth, because it is about giving people the chance to make the most of their HUMAN CAPITAL, is probably beyond the ability of statisticians to analyse rigorously. The most often used measure of income inequality is the GINI COEFFICIENT."
Inferior goods,"Products that are less in demand as consumers get richer. For NORMAL GOODS, DEMAND increases as consumers have more to spend."
Inflation target,"The goal of monetary policy in many countries is to ensure that inflation is neither too high nor too low. It became fashionable during the 1990s to set a country's central bank an explicit rate of inflation to target. By 1998, some 54 central banks had an inflation target, compared with just eight at the end of 1990, the year in which New Zealand's Reserve Bank became the first to be set a target. In most industrialised countries, the target, or, typically, the mid-point of a target range, for consumer-price inflation is between 1% and 2.5%. The reason it is not zero is that official price indices overstate inflation, and that the countries would prefer a little inflation to any deflation."
Information,"The oil that keeps the economy working smoothly. Economic EFFICIENCY is likely to be greatest when information is comprehensive, accurate and cheaply available. Many of the problems facing economies arise from people making decisions without all the information they need. One reason for the failure of the COMMAND ECONOMY is that GOVERNMENT planners were not good at gathering and processing information. Adam SMITH's metaphor of the INVISIBLE HAND is all about how, in many cases, free markets are much more efficient at processing information on the needs of all the participants in an economy than is the visible, and often dead, hand of state planners. ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION, when one party to a deal knows more than the other party, can be a serious source of inefficiency and MARKET FAILURE. Uncertainty can also impose large economic costs. The internet, by greatly increasing the availability and lowering the price of information, is helping to boost economic efficiency. But there are inefficiencies the internet will not be able to solve. Uncertainty will remain a huge source of economic inefficiency. Alas, potentially the most useful information, about what will happen in the future, is never available until it is too late."
Insider trading,"A practice that was made illegal in the United States in 1934 and in the UK in 1980, and is now banned (for SHARES, at least) in most countries. Insider trading involves using INFORMATION that is not in the public domain but that will move the PRICE of a share, BOND or currency when it is made public. An insider trade takes place when someone with privileged, confidential access to that information trades to take advantage of the fact that prices will move when the news gets out. This is frowned on because investors may lose confidence in FINANCIAL MARKETS if they see insiders taking advantage of advantageous ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION to enrich themselves at the expense of outsiders. But some economists reckon that insider trading leads to more efficient markets: by transmitting the inside information to the market, it makes the price of, say, a company's shares more accurate. This may be true, but most financial regulators are willing to sacrifice a degree of accuracy in pricing to ensure that outsiders (the great majority of investors) feel they are being treated fairly."
Institutional economics,See EVOLUTIONARY ECONOMICS.
Institutional investors,"The big hitters of the FINANCIAL MARKETS: pension funds, fund-management companies, INSURANCE companies, investment BANKS, HEDGE FUNDS, charitable endowment trusts. In the United States, around half of publicly traded SHARES are owned by institutions and half by individual investors. In the UK, institutions own over two-thirds of listed shares. This gives them considerable clout, including the ability to move the PRICES in financial markets and to call company bosses to account. But because institutions mostly invest other people's MONEY, they are themselves prone to AGENCY COSTS, sometimes acting against the best long-term interests of the people who trust them with their     SAVINGS."
Intangible assets,"Valuable things, even though you cannot drop them on your foot - an idea, say, especially one protected by a PATENT; an effective corporate culture; HUMAN CAPITAL; a popular brand. Contrast with TANGIBLE ASSETS."
Intellectual capital,The part of a country's or a firm's CAPITAL or an individual's HUMAN CAPITAL that consists of ideas rather than something more physical. It can often be protected through PATENTS or other intellectual property laws.
Interest rate,"INTEREST is usually expressed at an annual rate: the amount of interest that would be paid during a year divided by the amount of money loaned. Developed economies offer many different interest rates, reflecting the length of the loan and the riskiness and wealth of the borrower. People often use the term 'interest rate' when they mean the short-term interest rate charged to BANKS. For instance, when a CENTRAL BANK raises or cuts interest rates, it changes only the PRICE it charges to banks borrowing money overnight, expressed as an annual rate. BOND YIELDS are a better measure of the interest rate on loans that do not have to be repaid for many years. Unlike short-term interest rates, bond yields are determined not by central bankers but by the SUPPLY and DEMAND for MONEY, which is heavily influenced by the expected rate of INFLATION."
International aid,"A helping hand for poor countries from rich countries. This, at least, is the intention. In practice, in many cases aid has done little good for its intended recipients (improved health care is a notable exception) and has sometimes made matters worse. Poor countries that receive lots of aid grow no faster, on average, than those that receive very little. By contrast, perhaps the most successful aid programme ever - the MARSHALL PLAN for rebuilding Europe after the second world war - involved rich countries giving to other hitherto rich countries."
International Labour Organisation,See ILO.
International Monetary Fund,See IMF.
International trade,See FREE TRADE.
Invisible trade,"EXPORTS and IMPORTS of things you cannot touch or see: SERVICES, such as banking or advertising and other intangibles, such as copyrights. Invisible trade accounts for a growing slice of the value of world trade."
Inward investment,Investment from abroad; the opposite of OUTWARD INVESTMENT (see FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT).
J-curve,"The shape of the trend of a country’s trade balance following a DEVALUATION. A lower EXCHANGE RATE initially means cheaper EXPORTS and more expensive IMPORTS, making the current account worse (a bigger DEFICIT or smaller surplus). After a while, though, the volume of exports will start to rise because of their lower PRICE to foreign buyers, and domestic consumers will buy fewer of the costlier imports. Eventually, the trade balance will improve on what it was before the devaluation. If there is a currency APPRECIATION there may be an inverted J-curve."
Job search,"The time taken to find a new job. Because some people will devote all their time to this search, there will always be some FRICTIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT, even when there is otherwise FULL EMPLOYMENT."
Joint supply,"Some products or production processes have more than one use. For instance, cows can both provide milk and be eaten. If farmers increase the number of cows they own in response to an increase in DEMAND for milk, they are also likely to increase, a little later, the supply of meat, causing beef prices to fall."
"Keynes, John Maynard","A much quoted, great British economist, not famous for holding the same opinion for long. Born in 1883, he studied at Cambridge but came to reject much of the CLASSICAL ECONOMICS and NEO-CLASSICAL ECONOMICS associated with that university. Keynes helped set up the BRETTON WOODS framework, but he is best known for his General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, published in 1936 in the depths of the Great Depression. This invented modern MACROECONOMICS. It argued that economies could sometimes be stable (in EQUILIBRIUM) even when they did not have FULL EMPLOYMENT, but that a GOVERNMENT could remedy this under-employment problem by increasing PUBLIC SPENDING and/or reducing TAXATION, thereby increasing the level of aggregate DEMAND in the economy. Many politicians picked up on these ideas. As President Richard Nixon observed in 1971, 'We are all Keynesians now.' However, it is much debated whether Keynes would have supported the way many of them put his thoughts into practice."
Keynesian,"A branch of ECONOMICS, based, often loosely, on the ideas of KEYNES, characterised by a belief in active GOVERNMENT and suspicion of market outcomes. It was dominant in the 30 years following the second world war, and especially during the 1960s, when FISCAL POLICY became bigger-spending and looser in most developed countries as policymakers tried to kill off the BUSINESS CYCLE. During the 1970s, widely blamed for the rise in INFLATION, Keynesian policies gradually gave way to monetarism and microeconomic policies that owed much to the NEO-CLASSICAL ECONOMICS that Keynes had at times opposed. Even so, the idea that PUBLIC SPENDING and TAXATION have a crucial role to play in managing DEMAND, in order to move towards FULL EMPLOYMENT, remained at the heart of MACROECONOMIC POLICY in most countries, even after the monetarist and supply-side revolution of the 1980s and 1990s. Recently, a school of new, more pro-market Keynesian economists has emerged, believing that most markets work, but sometimes only slowly."
Kleptocracy,"Corrupt, thieving GOVERNMENT, in which the politicians and bureaucrats in charge use the powers of the state to feather their own nests. Russia in the years immediately after the fall of COMMUNISM was a clear-cut example, with Mafia-friendly GOVERNMENT members allocating themselves valuable SHARES during the PRIVATISATION of state-owned companies, accepting bribes from foreign businesses, not collecting taxes from “helpful” companies and siphoning off INTERNATIONAL AID into their personal OFFSHORE    BANK accounts."
Kondratieff wave,"A 50 year-long BUSINESS CYCLE, named after Nikolai Kondratieff, a Russian economist. He claimed to have identified cycles of economic activity lasting half a century or more in his 1925 book, The Long Waves in Economic Life. Because this implied that CAPITALISM was, ultimately, a stable system, in contrast to the Marxist view that it was self-destructively unstable, he ended up in one of Stalin's prisons, where he died. Alas, there is little hard evidence to support Kondratieff's conclusion."
Labour intensive,A production process that involves comparatively large amounts of LABOUR; the opposite of CAPITAL INTENSIVE.
Labour market flexibility,"A flexible LABOUR market is one in which it is easy and inexpensive for FIRMS to vary the amount of labour they use, including by changing the hours worked by each employee and by changing the number of employees. This often means minimal REGULATION of the terms of employment (no MINIMUM WAGE, say) and weak (or no) trade UNIONS. Such flexibility is characterised by its opponents as giving firms all the power, allowing them to fire employees at a moment's notice and leaving workers feeling insecure."
Labour theory of value,"The notion that the value of any good or service depends on how much LABOUR it uses up. First suggested by ADAM SMITH, it took a central place in the philosophy of KARL MARX. Some neo-classical economists disagreed with this theory, arguing that the PRICE of something was independent of how much labour went into producing it and was instead determined solely by SUPPLY and DEMAND."
Laffer curve,"Legend has it that in November 1974 Arthur Laffer, a young economist, drew a curve on a napkin in a Washington bar, linking AVERAGE tax rates to total tax revenue. Initially, higher tax rates would increase revenue, but at some point further increases in tax rates would cause revenue to fall, for instance by discouraging people from working. The curve became an icon of supply-side ECONOMICS. Some economists said that it proved that most governments could raise more revenue by cutting tax rates, an argument that was often cited in the 1980s by the tax-cutting governments of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. Other economists reckoned that most countries were still at a point on the curve at which raising tax rates would increase revenue. The lack of empirical evidence meant that nobody could really be sure where the United States and other countries were on the Laffer curve. However, after the Reagan administration cut tax rates revenue fell at first. American tax rates were already low compared with some countries, especially in continental Europe, and it remains possible that these countries are at a point on the Laffer curve where cutting tax rates would pay."
Lagging indicators,Old news. Some economic statistics move weeks or months after changes in the BUSINESS CYCLE or INFLATION. They may not be a reliable guide to the current state of an economy or its future path. Contrast with LEADING INDICATORS.
Laissez-faire,"Let-it-be ECONOMICS: the belief that an economy functions best when there is no interference by GOVERNMENT. It can be traced to the 18th-century French physiocrats, who believed in government according to the natural order and opposed MERCANTILISM. ADAM SMITH and others turned it into a central tenet of CLASSICAL ECONOMICS, as it allowed the INVISIBLE HAND to operate efficiently. (But even they saw a need for some limited government role in the economy.) In the 19th century, it inspired the British political movement that secured the repeal of the Corn Laws and promoted FREE TRADE, and gave birth to The Economist in 1843. In the 20th century, laissez-faire was often seen as synonymous with supporting MONOPOLY and allowing the BUSINESS CYCLE to boom and bust, and it came off second best against KEYNESIAN policies of interventionist government. However, mounting evidence of the inefficiency of state intervention inspired the free market policies of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, both of whom stressed the importance of laissez-faire."
Land tax,"Henry George, a 19th-century American eco­nomist, believed that taxes should be levied only on the value of LAND, not on LABOUR or CAPITAL. This 'single tax', he asserted in his book, PROGRESS AND POVERTY, would end UNEMPLOYMENT, POVERTY, INFLATION and INEQUALITY. Many countries levy some tax on land or property values, although George's single tax has never been fully implemented. This is mainly because of fears that it would drive down land PRICES too much or discourage efforts to improve the quality (that is, the economic value) of land. George addressed this concern by arguing that the tax should be levied only against the value of 'unimproved' land. Certainly, a land tax has obvious advantages: it is simple and cheap to levy; evasion is all but impossible; and it penalises owners who do not put their land to work."
Law and economics,"Laws can be an important source of economic ­EFFICIENCY - or inefficiency. Early economists such as ADAM SMITH often wrote about the economic impact of legal matters. But ECONOMICS subsequently focused more narrowly on things monetary and commercial. It was only in the 1940s and 1950s, at the University of Chicago Law School, that the discipline of law and economics was born. It is now a substantial branch of economics and has had an impact beyond the ivory towers."
LBO,See LEVERAGED BUY-OUT.
Leading indicators,"Economic crystal balls. Also known as cyclical ­indicators, these are groups of statistics that point to the future direction of the economy and the BUSINESS CYCLE. Certain economic variables, fairly consistently, precede changes in GDP and certain others precede changes in INFLATION. In some countries, statisticians combine the various different leading indicators into an overall leading index of economic GROWTH or inflation. However, there is not necessarily any causal relationship between the leading indicators and what they are predicting, which is why, like other crystal balls, they are fallible. Contrast with LAGGING INDICATORS."
Leveraged buy-out,"Buying a company using borrowed MONEY to pay most of the purchase PRICE. The DEBT is secured against the ASSETS of the company being acquired. The INTEREST will be paid out of the company’s future cashflow. Leveraged buy-outs (LBOs) became popular in the United States during the 1980s, as public DEBT markets grew rapidly and opened up to borrowers that would not previously have been able to raise loans worth millions of dollars to pursue what was often an unwilling target. Although some LBOs ended up with the borrower going bust, in most cases the need to meet demanding interest bills drove the new managers to run the firm more efficiently than their predecessors. For this reason, some economists see LBOs as a way of tackling AGENCY COSTS associated with corporate governance."
Liberal economics,LAISSEZ-FAIRE    CAPITALISM by another name.
Liberalisation,A policy of promoting LIBERAL ECONOMICS by limiting the role of GOVERNMENT to the things it can do to help the market economy work efficiently. This can include PRIVATISATION and DEREGULATION.
Life,"Human life is priceless. But this has not stopped economists trying to put a financial value on it. One reason is to help FIRMS and policymakers to make better decisions on how much to spend on costly safety measures designed to reduce the loss of life. Another is to help insurers and courts judge how much compensation to pay in the event of, say, a fatal accident."
Life-cycle hypothesis,"An attempt to explain the way that people split their INCOME between spending and saving, and the way that they borrow. Over their lifetime, a typical person's income varies by far more than how much they spend. On AVERAGE, young people have low incomes but big spending commitments: on investing in their HUMAN CAPITAL through education and training, building a family, buying a home, and so on. So they do not save much and often borrow heavily. As they get older their income generally rises, they pay off their mortgage, the children leave home and they prepare for retirement, so they sharply increase their saving and INVESTMENT. In retirement, their income is largely or entirely from state benefits and the saving and investment they did when working; they spend most or all of their income, and, by selling off ASSETS, often spend more than their income."
Liquidity preference,"The proportion of their ASSETS that FIRMS and in­dividuals choose to hold in varying degrees of ­LIQUIDITY. The more cash they have, the greater is their desire for liquidity."
Lock-in,See PATH DEPENDENCE.
Lump of labour fallacy,"One of the best-known fallacies in ECONOMICS is the notion that there is a fixed amount of work to be done - a lump of LABOUR - which can be shared out in different ways to create fewer or more jobs. For instance, suppose that everybody worked 10% fewer hours. FIRMS would need to hire more workers. Hey presto, UNEMPLOYMENT would shrink."
Lump-sum tax,"A tax that is the same amount for everybody, regardless of INCOME or wealth. Some economists argue that this is the most efficient form of TAXATION, as it does not distort incentives and thus it has no DEADWEIGHT COST. This is because each person knows that whatever they do they will have to pay the same amount. It is also cheap to administer, as there is no complex process of measuring each person's INCOME and ASSETS in order to calculate their tax bill. However, because rich and poor people pay the same, the tax may be perceived as unfair - as Margaret Thatcher found out when she introduced a lump-sum 'poll tax', a decision that was later to play a large part in her ousting as British prime minister."
Luxuries,"Goods and SERVICES that have a high ELASTICITY of DEMAND. When the PRICE of, say, a Caribbean holiday rises, the number of vacations demanded falls sharply. Likewise, demand for Caribbean holidays rises significantly as AVERAGE    INCOME increases, certainly by more than demand for many NORMAL GOODS. Contrast this with necessities, such as milk or bread, which people usually demand in quite similar quantities whatever their income and whatever the price."
Macroeconomic policy,"Top-down policy by GOVERNMENT and CENTRAL BANKS, usually intended to maximise GROWTH while keeping down INFLATION and UNEMPLOYMENT. The main instruments of macroeconomic policy are changes in the rate of INTEREST and MONEY SUPPLY, known as MONETARY POLICY, and changes in TAXATION and PUBLIC SPENDING, known as FISCAL POLICY. The fact that unemployment and inflation often rise sharply, and that growth often slows or GDP falls, may be evidence of poorly executed macro­economic policy. However, BUSINESS CYCLES may simply be an unavoidable fact of economic life that macroeconomic policy, however well conducted, can never be sure of conquering."
Marginal,"The difference made by one extra unit of something. Marginal revenue is the extra revenue earned by selling one more unit of something. The marginal PRICE is how much extra a consumer must pay to buy one extra unit. Marginal UTILITY is how much extra utility a person gets from consuming (or doing) an extra unit of something. The marginal product of LABOUR is how much extra OUTPUT a firm would get by employing an extra worker, or by getting an existing worker to put in an extra hour on the job. The marginal PROPENSITY to consume (or to save) measures by how much a household's CONSUMPTION (SAVINGS) would increase if its INCOME rose by, say, $1. The marginal tax rate measures how much extra tax you would have to pay if you earned an extra dollar."
Market capitalisation,The market value of a company’s SHARES: the quoted share PRICE multiplied by the total number of shares that the company has issued.
Market failure,When a market left to itself does not allocate resources efficiently. Interventionist politicians usually allege market failure to justify their interventions. Economists have identified four main sorts or causes of market failure.
Market forces,"Shorthand for the pressures from buyers and sellers in a market, rather than those coming from a GOVERNMENT planner or from REGULATION."
Market power,"When one buyer or seller in a market has the ability to exert significant influence over the quantity of goods and SERVICES traded or the PRICE at which they are sold. Market power does not exist when there is PERFECT COMPETITION, but it does when there is a MONOPOLY, MONOPSONY or OLIGOPOLY."
Marshall Plan,"Probably the most successful programme of INTERNATIONAL AID and nation building in history. It was named after General George Marshall, an American secretary of state, who at the end of the second world war proposed giving aid to Western Europe to rebuild its war-torn economies. North America gave around 1% of its GDP in total between 1948 and 1952; most of it came from the United States and the rest from Canada. The Americans left it to the Europeans to work out the details on allocating aid, which may be why, according to most economic analyses, it achieved more success than latter day aid programmes in which most of the decisions on how the MONEY is spent are made by the donors. The main institution through which aid was administered was the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC), which in 1961 became the OECD. Nowadays, whenever there is a proposal for the international community to rebuild an economy damaged by war, such as Iraq's in 2003, you are sure to hear the phrase 'new Marshall Plan'."
"Marshall, Alfred","A British economist (1842-1924), who developed some of the most important concepts in MICRO­ECONOMICS. In his best-known work, Principles of Economics, he retained the emphasis on the importance of costs, which was standard in CLASSICAL ECONOMICS. But he added to it, helping to create NEO-CLASSICAL ECONOMICS, by explaining that the OUTPUT and PRICE of a product are determined by both SUPPLY and DEMAND, and that MARGINAL costs and benefits are crucial. He was the first economist to explain that demand falls as price increases, and that therefore the DEMAND CURVE slopes downwards from left to right. He was also first with the concept of PRICE ELASTICITY of demand and CONSUMER SURPLUS."
"Marx, Karl","Much followed, and much misunderstood, German economist (1818–83). His two best-known works were the Communist Manifesto, written in 1848 with Friedrich Engels, and Das Kapital, in four volumes published between 1867 and 1910. Most of his economic assumptions were drawn from orthodox CLASSICAL ECONOMICS, but he used them to reach highly unorthodox conclusions. Although claimed and blamed as the inspiration of some of the most virulently anti-market governments the world has ever seen, he was not wholly against CAPITALISM. Indeed, he praised it for rescuing millions of people from “the idiocy of rural life”. Even so, he thought it was doomed. A shortage of DEMAND would concentrate economic power and wealth in ever fewer hands, producing an ever-larger and more miserable proletariat. This would eventually rise up, creating a “dictatorship of the proletariat” and leading eventually to a “withering away” of the state. Marx thought that this version of history was inevitable. So far, history has proved him wrong, largely because capitalism has delivered a much better deal to the masses than he believed it would."
Mean reversion,"The tendency for subsequent observations of a random variable to be closer to its mean than the current observation. For example, if the current number is 7, the average is 5, and there is mean reversion, then the next observation is likelier to be 6 than 8."
Medium term,"Somewhere between SHORT-TERMISM, which is bad, and the LONG RUN, lies the hallowed ground of the medium term – far enough away to discourage myopic behaviour by decision makers but close enough to be meaningful. But not many governments say exactly how long they think the medium term is."
Menu costs,"How much it costs to change PRICES. Just as a restaurant has to print a new menu when it changes the price of its food, so many other FIRMS face a substantial outlay each time they cut or raise what they charge. Such menu costs mean that firms may be reluctant to change their prices every time there is a shift in the balance of SUPPLY and DEMAND, so there will be STICKY PRICES and the market for their OUTPUT will be in DISEQUILIBRIUM. The Internet may sharply reduce menu costs as it allows prices to be changed at the click of a mouse, which may improve EFFICIENCY by keeping markets more often in EQUILIBRIUM."
Mergers and acquisitions,"When two businesses join together, either by merging or by one company taking over the other. There are three sorts of mergers between FIRMS: HORIZONTAL INTEGRATION, in which two similar firms tie the knot; VERTICAL INTEGRATION, in which two firms at different stages in the SUPPLY chain get together; and DIVERSIFICATION, when two companies with nothing in common jump into bed. These can be a voluntary marriage of equals; a voluntary takeover of one firm by another; or a hostile takeover, in which the management of the target firm resists the advances of the buyer but is eventually forced to accept a deal by its current owners. For reasons that are not at all clear, merger activity generally happens in waves. One possible explanation is that when SHARE    PRICES are low, many firms have a MARKET CAPITALISATION that is low relative to the value of their ASSETS. This makes them attractive to buyers (see TOBIN). In theory, the different sorts of mergers have different sorts of potential benefits. However, the damning lesson of merger waves stretching back over the past 50 years is that, with one big ex ception - the spate of LEVERAGED BUY-OUTS in the United States during the 1980s - they have often failed to deliver benefits that justify the costs."
Minimum wage,"A minimum rate of pay that FIRMS are legally obliged to pay their workers. Most industrial countries have a minimum wage, although certain sorts of workers are often exempted, such as young people or part-timers. Most economists reckon that a minimum wage, if it is doing what it is meant to do, will lead to higher UNEMPLOYMENT than there would be without it. The main justification offered by politicians for having a minimum wage is that the wage that would be decided by buyers and sellers in a free market would be so low that it would be immoral for people to work for it. So the minimum wage should be above the market-clearing wage, in which case fewer workers would be demanded at that wage than would be hired at the market wage. How many fewer will depend on how far the minimum wage is above the market wage."
Misery index,"The sum of a country’s INFLATION and UNEMPLOYMENT rates. The higher the score, the greater is the economic misery."
Mixed economy,"A market economy in which both private-sector FIRMS and firms owned by GOVERNMENT take part in economic activity. The proportions of public and private enterprise in the mix vary a great deal among countries. Since the 1980s, the public role in most mixed economies declined as NATIONALISATION gave way to PRIVATISATION."
Mobility,"The easier it is for the FACTORS OF PRODUCTION to move to where they are most valuable, the more efficient the allocation of the world's scarce resources is likely to be and the faster GDP will grow. Apart from continental drift, LAND is immobile. CAPITAL has long been extremely mobile within countries, and, with the rise of GLOBALISATION, it is now able to move easily around the world. ENTERPRISE is mobile, although to what extent depends on the particular ENTREPRENEUR. Some members of the LABOUR market zoom around the world to work; others will not move to the next town."
Modelling,"When economists make a number of simplified assumptions about how the economy, or some part of it, behaves, and then see what this implies in various different scenarios. MILTON FRIEDMAN argued that economic models should not be judged on the basis of the validity of their assumptions, but on the accuracy of their predictions. An expert billiards player, he said, may not know the laws of physics, but acts as if he knows such laws. So his behaviour could be predicted accurately with a model that assumes he knows the laws of physics. Likewise, the behaviour of people making economic decisions may be accurately predicted by a model that assumes their goal is, say, PROFIT MAXIMISATION, even if they are not actually conscious of this being their goal. The more complex the thing being modelled, the harder it is to get right. Economic FORECASTING has a poor overall track record. The more micro­economic the thing being modelled, the more likely it is that a model can be designed that will deliver accurate predictions."
Modern portfolio theory,One of the most important and influential economic theories about finance and INVESTMENT. Modern portfolio theory is based upon the simple idea that DIVERSIFICATION can produce the same TOTAL RETURNS for less RISK. Combining many financial ASSETS in a portfolio is less risky than putting all your investment eggs in one basket. The theory has four basic premises.
Monetary neutrality,"Changes in the MONEY SUPPLY have no effect on real economic variables such as OUTPUT, real INTEREST rates and UNEMPLOYMENT. If the CENTRAL BANK doubles the money supply, the PRICE level will double too. Twice as many dollars means half as much bang for the buck. This theory, a core belief of CLASSICAL ECONOMICS, was first put forward in the 18th century by David Hume. He set out the classical dichotomy that economic variables come in two varieties, nominal and real, and that the things that influence nominal variables do not necessarily affect the real economy. Today few economists think that pure monetary neutrality exists in the real world, at least in the short run. Inflation does affect the real economy because, for instance, there may be STICKY PRICES or MONEY ILLUSION."
Money illusion,"When people are misled by INFLATION into thinking that they are getting richer, when in fact the value of MONEY is declining. Whether, and how much, people are fooled by inflation is much debated by economists. Money illusion, a phrase coined by KEYNES, is used by some economists to argue that a small amount of inflation may not be a bad thing  and could even be beneficial, helping to “grease the wheels” of the economy. Because of money illusion, workers like to see their nominal WAGES rise, giving them the illusion that their circumstances are improving, even though in real (inflation-adjusted) terms they may be no better off. During periods of high inflation double-digit pay rises (as well as, say, big increases in the value of their homes) can make people feel richer even if they are not really better off. When inflation is low, GROWTH in real incomes may hardly register."
Money markets,"Any market where MONEY and other liquid ASSETS (such as TREASURY BILLS) can be lent and borrowed for between a few hours and a few months. Contrast with CAPITAL MARKETS, where longer-term CAPITAL changes hands."
Money supply,"The amount of MONEY available in an economy. In the heyday of MONETARISM in the early 1980s, economists pounced upon the monthly (in some countries, even weekly) MONEY-SUPPLY numbers for clues about future INFLATION. CENTRAL BANKS aim to manage DEMAND by controlling the SUPPLY of money through OPEN-MARKET OPERATIONS, RESERVE REQUIREMENTS and changing the rate of INTEREST (to be exact, the DISCOUNT RATE)."
Moral hazard,"One of two main sorts of MARKET FAILURE often associated with the provision of INSURANCE. The other is ADVERSE SELECTION. Moral hazard means that people with insurance may take greater risks than they would do without it because they know they are protected, so the insurer may get more claims than it bargained for. (See also DEPOSIT INSURANCE, LENDER OF LAST RESORT, IMF and WORLD BANK.)"
Most-favoured nation,"Equal treatment, at least, in international trade. If country A grants country B the status of most-favoured nation, it means that B's EXPORTS will face TARIFF that are no higher (and also no lower) than those applied to any other country that A calls a most-favoured nation. This will be the most favourable tariff treatment available to IMPORTS."
NAFTA,"Short for North American Free-Trade Agreement. In 1993, the United States, Mexico and Canada agreed to lower the barriers to trade among the three economies. The formation of this regional TRADE AREA was opposed by many politicians in all three countries. In the United States and Canada, in particular, there were fears that NAFTA would result in domestic job losses to cheaper locations in Mexico. In the early years of the agreement, however, most studies found that the economic gains far outweighed any costs."
Nation building,"Creating a country that works out of one that does not - because the old order has collapsed (as in the former Soviet Union), or been destroyed by war (Iraq), or never really functioned in the first place (Afghanistan). To transform a failed country can involve establishing order through the rule of law and creating legitimate government and other effective social institutions, as well as a credible currency and a functioning market economy. Nation building is rarely easy, and often fiendishly difficult, especially where there are deep ethnic, religious or political divisions in the population or the country has no history of ever functioning effectively. Outside expertise, such as from the world bank, and money (as in, most famouly, the Marshall Plan) can help, but they are no guarantee of success."
National income,"Shorthand for everything that is produced, earned or spent in a country (see GDP and GNP)."
Negative income tax,"A way of building redistribution into the TAXATION system by taking MONEY from people with high incomes and paying it to people with low incomes. Because it takes place automatically through the tax system, it may attach less stigma to the receipt of financial help than some other forms of WELFARE assistance. However, it may also discourage recipients from working to increase their INCOME (see POVERTY TRAP), which is why some countries have introduced a form of negative income tax that is available only to the working poor. In the United States, this is known as the earned income tax credit."
Neo-classical economics,"The school of ECONOMICS that developed the free-market ideas of CLASSICAL ECONOMICS into a full-scale model of how an economy works. The best-known neo-classical economist was ALFRED MARSHALL, the father of MARGINAL analysis. Neo-classical thinking, which mostly assumes that markets tend towards EQUILIBRIUM, was attacked by KEYNES and became unfashionable during the Keynesian-dominated decades after the second world war. But, thanks to economists such as MILTON FRIEDMAN, many neo-classical ideas have since become widely accepted and uncontroversial."
Net present value,"A measure used to help decide whether or not to proceed with an INVESTMENT. Net means that both the costs and benefits of the investment are in cluded. To calculate net present value (NPV), first add together all the expected benefits from the investment, now and in the future. Then add together all the expected costs. Then work out what these future benefits and costs are worth now by adjusting future cashflow using an appropriate DISCOUNT RATE. Then subtract the costs from the benefits. If the NPV is negative, then the investment cannot be justified by the EXPECTED RETURNS. If the NPV is positive, it can, although it pays to make comparisons with the NPVs of alternative investment opportunities before going ahead."
Network effect,"When the value of a good to a consumer changes because the number of people using it changes. For instance, owning a phone becomes more valuable as more people are plugged into the telephone network. Network effects are sometimes called network EXTERNALITY, although this implies, often wrongly, that the benefits from being part of a network are a sort of MARKET FAILURE. They give a huge COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE to the firm that owns the network. This INCUMBENT ADVANTAGE arises because a new entrant must persuade people to join a network that starts with fewer members, and thus may be less valuable to them than the network they are currently in. This is why markets for products with network effects are often dominated by only a few firms or a single MONOPOLY. Some economists argue that many recent technological innovations, notably the Internet, have large positive network effects, which make possible much higher PRODUCTIVITY and growth than in the past."
Neutrality,See FISCAL NEUTRALITY and MONETARY NEUTRALITY.
New economy,"In the last years of the 20th century, some economists argued that developments in information technology and GLOBALISATION had given birth to a new economy (first, in the United States), which had a higher rate of PRODUCTIVITY and GROWTH than the old economy it replaced. Some went further, adding that in the new economy INFLATION was dead, the BUSINESS CYCLE abolished and the traditional rules of ECONOMICS were redundant. These claims were highly controversial. Other economists pointed out that similar predictions had been made during earlier periods of rapid technological change, yet the nature of economics was not fundamentally altered."
New growth theory,See GROWTH.
New trade theory,"Although most economists support FREE TRADE, in the 1970s a growing number of them became increasingly puzzled by the large differences between the predictions of free trade theory and real-world trade flows. Their solution to this puzzle is known as new trade theory."
NGO,"Short for non-government organisation. Although such groups have existed for generations (in the early 1800s, the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society played a powerful part in abolishing slavery laws), recent social and economic shifts have given these typically voluntary, non-profit, 'issue-driven' organisations new life. The collapse of COMMUNISM, the spread of democracy, technological change and economic integration (GLOBALISATION, in short) have each helped NGOs grow. Globalisation itself has exacerbated a host of worries about the environment, LABOUR rights, human rights, consumer rights, and so on. Democratisation and technological progress have revolutionised the way in which citizens can unite to express their disquiet."
Nobel prize for economics,"The sixth annual prize established in memory of Alfred Nobel. Strictly speaking, this is not a fully fledged Nobel prize, as it was not mentioned in Nobel’s will, unlike the five prizes established earlier for peace, literature, medicine, chemistry and physics. Still, the title of Nobel laureate and the $1m award stumped up each year by Sweden’s CENTRAL BANK make it worth winning. Since 1969, when its first (joint) winners hailed from Norway and the Netherlands, it has been won mostly by American economists, many of them of the CHICAGO SCHOOL."
Nominal value,"The value of anything expressed simply in the MONEY of the day. Since INFLATION means that money can lose its value over time, nominal figures can be misleading when used to compare values in different periods. It is better to compare their real value, by adjusting the nominal figures to remove the inflationary distortions."
Non-price competition,"Trying to win business from rivals other than by charging a lower PRICE. Methods include ADVERTISING, slightly differentiating your product, improving its quality, or offering free gifts or discounts on subsequent purchases. Non-price competition is particularly common when there is an OLIGOPOLY, perhaps because it can give an impression of fierce rivalry while the FIRMS are actually colluding to keep prices high."
Normal goods,"When average INCOME increases, the DEMAND for normal goods increases, too. The opposite of INFERIOR GOODS."
Normative economics,"economics that tries to change the world, by suggesting policies for increasing economic WELFARE.  The opposite of POSITIVE ECONOMICS, which is content to try to describe the world as it is, rather than prescribe ways to make it better."
NPV,See NET PRESENT VALUE.
Null hypothesis,"A statement that is being put to the test. In ECONOMETRICS, economists often start with a null hypothesis that a particular variable equals a particular number, then crunch their data to see if they can prove or disprove it, according to the laws of STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. The null hypothesis chosen is often the reverse of what the experimenter actually believes; it may be put forward to allow the data to contradict it."
OECD,"The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, a Paris-based club for industrialised countries and the best of the rest. It was formed in 1961, building on the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC), which had been established under the MARSHALL PLAN. By 2003, its membership had risen to 30 countries, from an original 20. Together, OECD countries produce two-thirds of the world's goods and SERVICES. The OECD provides a policy talking shop for governments. It produces forests-worth of documents discussing public policy ideas, as well as detailed empirical analysis. It also publishes reports on the economic performance of individual countries, which usually contain lots of valuable information even if they are rarely very critical of the policies implemented by a member GOVERNMENT."
Okun's law,"A description of what happens to UNEMPLOYMENT when the rate of GROWTH of GDP changes, based on empirical research by Arthur Okun (1928-80). It predicts that if GDP grows at around 3% a year, the jobless rate will be unchanged. If it grows faster, the unemployment rate will fall by half of what the growth rate exceeds 3% by; that is, if GDP grows by 5%, unemployment will fall by 1 percentage point. Likewise, a lesser, say 2%, increase in GDP would be associated with a half a percentage point increase in the jobless rate. This relationship is not carved in stone, as it merely reflects the American economy during the period studied by Okun. Even so, in most econo mies Okun's Law is a reasonable rule of thumb for estimating the likely impact on jobs of changes in OUTPUT."
OPEC,"The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, a CARTEL set up in 1960 that wrought havoc in industrialised countries during the 1970s and early 1980s by forcing up oil prices (which quadrupled in a few weeks during 1973-74 alone), resulting in high INFLATION and slow GROWTH. A lot of productive CAPITAL equipment that had been viable at lower oil prices proved to be unprofitable to run at the higher prices and was shut down. Some economists reckon that MARKET FORCES would have driven up oil prices anyway and that OPEC merely capitalised on the opportunity. Since the early 1980s, OPEC's influence has waned. Many firms have switched to production methods that need less oil, or less energy altogether. Non-OPEC producers such as the UK have brought new oil fields on stream. And some individual members of the cartel have broken ranks by failing to restrict their oil production, resulting in lower oil prices."
Open economy,"An economy that allows the unrestricted flow of people, CAPITAL, goods and SERVICES across its borders; the opposite of a CLOSED ECONOMY."
Optimal currency area,"A geographical area within which it would pay to have a single currency. An optimal currency area can come in many sizes. Some may span several countries and others may be smaller than an individual country. The benefits of having one currency are lower foreign exchange and currency HEDGING costs and more transparent pricing (because every PRICE is expressed in the same currency). But unless the single currency is used within an optimal currency area, these benefits may be dwarfed by the costs. A single currency means a single MONETARY POLICY  and no opportunity for one part of the currency area to change its EXCHANGE RATE with the other parts. This can be a big problem if a country or region is likely to suffer from ASYMMETRIC SHOCKS that affect it differently from the rest of the single-currency area, because it will no longer be able to respond by loosening its national monetary policy or devaluing its currency. This may not be an insuperable problem if workers in the affected country are able and willing to move freely to other countries; if WAGES and prices are flexible and can adjust to the shock; or if FISCAL POLICY can shift resources to areas hurt by a shock from areas that are not hurt. For a currency area to be optimal, ideally asymmetric shocks should be rare, implying that the economies involved are on similar BUSINESS CYCLES and have similar structures. Moreover, the single monetary policy should affect all the constituent parts in the same way (an INTEREST    RATE cut should not, say, reduce UNEMPLOYMENT in one part and increase INFLATION in another). There should be no cultural, linguistic or legal barriers to LABOUR mobility across frontiers; there should be wage flexibility; and there should be some system for transferring resources to regions that are suffering. In practice, few of the parts of the world that have a single currency are optimal currency areas, probably including the EURO ZONE, although having a single currency often makes them become gradually more alike and thus more optimal."
Optimum,"As good as it gets, given the constraints you are operating within. For the concept of optimum to mean anything, there must be both a goal, say, to maximise economic WELFARE, and a set of constraints, such as an available stock of scarce economic resources. Optimising is the process of doing the best you can in the circumstances."
Output,The fruit of economic activity: whatever is produced by using the FACTORS OF PRODUCTION.
Output gap,"How far an economy’s current OUTPUT is below what it would be at full CAPACITY. On average, INFLATION rises when output is above potential and falls when output is below potential. However, in the short run, the relationship between inflation and the output gap can deviate from the longer-term pattern and can thus be misleading. Alas for policymakers – because nobody really knows what an economy’s potential output is, the size and even the direction of the output gap can easily be misdiagnosed, which can contribute to serious errors in MACROECONOMIC POLICY."
Outward investment,Investing abroad; the opposite of INWARD    INVESTMENT.
Over the counter,"In the case of drugs, those that can be purchased without a prescription from a doctor. In the case of financial SECURITIES, those that are bought or sold through a private dealer or BANK rather than on a financial exchange."
Overheating,When an economy is growing too fast and its productive CAPACITY cannot keep up with DEMAND. It often boils over into INFLATION.
Pareto efficiency,"A situation in which nobody can be made better off without making somebody else worse off. Named after Vilfredo Pareto (1843–1923), an Italian economist. If an economy’s resources are being used inefficiently, it ought to be possible to make somebody better off without anybody else becoming worse off. In reality, change often produces losers as well as winners. Pareto efficiency does not help judge whether this sort of change is economically good or bad."
Paris Club,"The name given to the arrangements through which countries reschedule their official DEBT; that is, money borrowed from other governments rather than BANKS or private FIRMS. The club is based on Avenue Kléber in Paris. Its members are the 19 founders of the OECD as well as Russia. Other institutions such as the WORLD BANK attend in an ­informal role. Rescheduling requires the consensus agreement of members and must not favour one CREDITOR nation over another. Private debt re­scheduling takes place through the London Club."
Patents,"In 1899 the commissioner of the American Office of Patents recommended that his office be abolished because “everything that can be invented has been invented”. The fact that there has been so much INNOVATION during the subsequent 100 years may owe something to the existence of patents. Economists reckon that if people are going to spend the time and MONEY needed to think up and develop new products, they need to be fairly confident that if the idea works they will earn a decent PROFIT. Patents help achieve this by granting the inventor a temporary MONOPOLY over the idea, to stop it being stolen by imitators who have not borne any of the development RISK and costs. Like any monopoly, patents create inefficiency because of the lack of COMPETITION to produce and sell the product. So economists debate how long patent protection should last.  There is also debate about which sorts of innovation require the encouragement of a potential monopoly to make them happen. Furthermore, the pace of innovation in some industries has sharply reduced the number of years during which a patent is valuable. Some economists say that this shows that patents do not play a large part in the process of innovation."
Path dependence,"History matters. Where you have been in the past determines where you are now and where you can go in future. Indeed, even small, apparently trivial, differences in the path you have taken can have huge consequences for where you are and can go. In ECONOMICS, path dependence refers to the way in which apparently insignificant events and choices can have huge consequences for the development of a market or an economy."
Peak pricing,"When CAPACITY is fixed and DEMAND varies during a time period, it may make sense to charge above-AVERAGE    PRICES when demand peaks. Because this will divert some peak demand to cheaper off-peak periods, it will reduce the total amount of capacity needed at the peak and reduce the amount of capacity lying idle at off-peak times, thus resulting in a more efficient use of resources. Peak pricing is common in SERVICES with substantial fixed capacity, such as electricity supply and rail transport, as anybody who pays higher fares to travel during rush hours knows only too well."
Percentage point,"A unit of size, a one-hundredth of the total. Not to be confused with percentage change. When something increases by 1 percentage point this may be quite different from a 1% increase. For instance, if GDP grew last year by 1% and this year by 2%, the GROWTH rate this year increased by 1 percentage point compared with last year (the difference between 1% and 2%) and also by 100% (2% is double 1%). A 1% increase would mean that the growth rate this year was only 1.01%."
Percentile,"Part of the “ile” family that signposts positions on a scale of numbers (see also QUARTILE). The top percentile on, say, the distribution of INCOME, is the richest 1% of the POPULATION."
Permanent income hypothesis,"Over their lives, people try to spread their spending more evenly than their INCOME. The permanent income hypothesis, developed by MILTON FRIEDMAN, says that a person's spending decisions are guided  by what they think over their lifetime will be their AVERAGE (also known as permanent) income. A sharp increase in short-term income will not result in an equally sharp increase in short-term CONSUMPTION. What if somebody unexpectedly comes into money, say by winning the lottery? The permanent income hypothesis suggests that people will save most of any such WINDFALL GAINS. Reality may be somewhat different. (See LIFE-CYCLE HYPOTHESIS.)"
Pigou effect,"Named after Arthur Pigou (1877-1959), a sort of WEALTH EFFECT resulting from DEFLATION. A fall in the PRICE level increases the REAL VALUE of people's SAVINGS, making them feel wealthier and thus causing them to spend more. This increase in DEMAND can lead to higher employment."
Plaza Accord,"On September 22nd 1985, finance ministers from the world's five biggest economies - the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and the UK - announced the Plaza Accord at the eponymous New York hotel. Each country made specific promises on economic policy: the United States pledged to cut the federal deficit, Japan promised a looser [economics-term KEY-""MONETARY POLICY""]monetary policy[/economics-term] and a range of financial-sector reforms, and Germany proposed tax cuts. All countries agreed to intervene in currency markets as necessary to get the dollar down. Perhaps not surprisingly, not all the promises were kept (least of all the American one on deficit cutting), but even so the plan turned out to be spectacularly successful. By the end of 1987, the dollar had fallen by 54% against both the D-mark and the yen from its peak in February 1985. This sharp drop led to a new fear: of an uncontrolled dollar plunge. So in 1987 another big international plan, the Louvre Accord, was hatched to stabilise the dollar. Again specific policy pledges were made (the United States to tighten fiscal policy, Japan to loosen monetary policy). Again the participants promised currency intervention if major currencies moved outside an agreed, but unpublished, set of ranges. The dollar promptly rose."
Positional goods,"Things that the Joneses buy. Some things are bought for their intrinsic usefulness, for instance, a hammer or a washing machine. Positional goods are bought because of what they say about the person who buys them. They are a way for a person to establish or signal their status relative to people who do not own them: fast cars, holidays in the most fashionable resorts, clothes from trendy designers. By necessity, the quantity of these goods is somewhat fixed, because to increase SUPPLY too much would mean that they were no longer positional. What would owning a Rolls-Royce say about you if everybody owned one? Fears that the rise of positional goods would limit GROWTH, since by definition they had to be in scarce supply, have so far proved misplaced. Entrepreneurs have come up with ever more ingenious ways for people to buy status, thus helping developed economies to keep growing."
Positive economics,"ECONOMICS that describes the world as it is, rather than trying to change it. The opposite of NORMATIVE ECONOMICS, which suggests policies for increasing economic WELFARE."
Poverty trap,Another name for the UNEMPLOYMENT TRAP.
PPP,See PURCHASING POWER PARITY.
Precautionary motive,"Keeping some MONEY handy, just in case. One of three motives for holding money identified by KEYNES, along with the transactional motive (having the cash to pay for planned purchases) and the speculative motive (you think ASSET prices are going to fall, so you sell your assets for cash)."
Predatory pricing,"Charging low PRICES now so you can charge much higher prices later. The predator charges so little that it may sustain losses over a period of time, in the hope that its rivals will be driven out of business. Clearly, this strategy makes sense only if the predatory firm is able eventually to establish a MONOPOLY. Some advocates of anti-DUMPING policies say that cheap IMPORTS are examples of predatory pricing. In practice, the evidence gives little support for this view. Indeed, in general, predatory pricing is quite rare. It is certainly much less common in practice than it might appear from the propaganda of FIRMS that are under pricing pressure from more efficient competitors."
Preference,What consumers want (see REVEALED PREFERENCE).
Present value,See NET PRESENT VALUE.
Price discrimination,"When a firm charges different customers different PRICES for the same product. For producers, the perfect world would be one in which they could charge each customer a different price: the price that each customer would be willing to pay. This would maximise PRODUCER SURPLUS. This cannot happen, not least because sellers do not know how much any individual would pay."
Price elasticity,"A measure of the responsiveness of DEMAND to a change in PRICE. If demand changes by more than the price has changed, the good is price-elastic. If demand changes by less than the price, it is price-inelastic. Economists also measure the ELASTICITY of demand to changes in the INCOME of consumers."
Price mechanism,The process by which markets set PRICES.
Price regulation,"When PRICES of, say, a PUBLIC UTILITY are regulated, giving producers an incentive to maximise their profits by reducing their costs as much as possible. Contrast with RATE OF RETURN REGULATION."
Price/earnings ratio,"A crude method of judging whether SHARES are cheap or expensive; the ratio of the market PRICE of a share to the company's earnings (PROFIT) per share. The higher the price/earnings (P/E) ratio, the more investors are buying a company's shares in the expectation that it will make larger profits in future than now. In other words, the higher the P/E ratio, the more optimistic investors are being."
Principal-agent theory,See AGENCY COSTS.
Prisoners' dilemma,"A favourite example in GAME THEORY, which shows why co-operation is difficult to achieve even when it is mutually beneficial. Two prisoners have been arrested for the same offence and are held in different cells. Each has two options: confess, or say nothing. There are three possible outcomes. One could confess and agree to testify against the other as state witness, receiving a light sentence while his fellow prisoner receives a heavy sentence. They can both say nothing and may be lucky and get light sentences or even be let off, owing to lack of firm evidence. Or they may both confess and probably get lighter individual sentences than one would have received had he said nothing and the other had testified against him. The second outcome would be the best for both prisoners. However, the RISK that the other might confess and turn state witness is likely to encourage both to confess, landing both with sentences that they might have avoided had they been able to co-operate in remaining silent. In an OLIGOPOLY, FIRMS often behave like these prisoners, not setting PRICES as high as they could do if they only trusted the other firms not to undercut them. As a result, they are worse off."
Private equity,"When a firm’s SHARES    are held privately and not traded in the public markets. Private equity includes shares in both mature private companies and, as VENTURE CAPITAL,     in newly started businesses. As it is less liquid than publicly traded EQUITY,      investors in private equity expect on average to earn a higher EQUITY RISK PREMIUM from it."
Privatisation,"Selling state-owned businesses to private investors. This policy was associated initially with Margaret Thatcher's government in the 1980s, which privatised numerous companies, including PUBLIC UTILITY businesses such as British Telecom, British Gas, and electricity and water companies. During the 1990s, privatisation became a favourite policy of governments all over the world."
Probability,"How likely something is to happen, usually expressed as the ratio of the number of ways the outcome may occur to the number of total possible outcomes for the event. For instance, each time you throw a dice there are six possible outcomes, but in only one of these can a six come up. Thus the probability of throwing a six on any given throw is one in six. The fact that you threw a six last time does not alter the one-in-six probability of throwing a six next time (see RISK)."
Producer prices,See FACTORY PRICES.
Producer surplus,"The difference between what a supplier is paid for a good or service and what it cost to SUPPLY. Added to CONSUMER SURPLUS, it provides a measure of the total economic benefit of a sale."
Profit margin,A firm’s PROFIT expressed as a percentage of its turnover or sales.
Profit maximisation,"The presumed goal of FIRMS. In practice, business people often trade off making as much profit as possible against other goals, such as building business empires, being popular with staff and enjoying life. The growing popularity in recent years of paying bosses with SHARES in their firm may have reduced the AGENCY COSTS that arise because they are the hired hands of shareholders, making them more likely to pursue profit maximisation."
Progressive taxation,TAXATION that takes a larger proportion of a taxpayer's INCOME the higher the income is. (See VERTICAL EQUITY.)
Propensity,"ECONOMICS abounds with propensities to do various things: consume, save, invest, import, and so on. In each case, it is important to distinguish between the AVERAGE propensity and the MARGINAL one. The average propensity to consume is simply total CONSUMPTION divided by total INCOME. The marginal propensity to consume measures how much of each extra dollar of income is consumed: the percentage change in consumption divided by the percentage change in income. The value of the marginal propensity to consume, which determines the MULTIPLIER, is harder to predict than the value of the average propensity to consume."
Prospect theory,"A theory of 'irrational' economic behaviour. Prospect theory holds that there are recurring biases driven by psychological factors that influence people's choices under uncertainty. In particular, it assumes that people are more motivated by losses than by gains and as a result will devote more energy to avoiding loss than to achieving gain. The theory is based on the experimental work of two psychologists, Daniel Kahneman (who won a nobel prize for economics for it) and Amos Tversky (1937-96). It is an important component of BEHAVIOURAL ECONOMICS."
Public goods,"Things that can be consumed by everybody in a society, or nobody at all. They have three characteristics. They are:"
Public spending,"Spending by national and local GOVERNMENT and some government-backed institutions. See FISCAL POLICY, golden rule and BUDGET."
Public utility,"A firm providing essential services to the public, such as water, electricity and postal services, usually involving elements of NATURAL MONOPOLY. Food is essential, but because it is provided in a competitive market, food SUPPLY is not usually regarded as a public utility. Because public utilities have some MONOPOLY power, they are typically subject to some REGULATION by GOVERNMENT, such as PRICE controls and perhaps an obligation to provide their services to everybody, even to those who cannot afford to pay a market price (the universal service obligation). Public utilities are often owned by the state, although this has become less common as a result of PRIVATISATION."
Public-private,"Using private firms to carry out aspects of government. This has become increasingly popular since the early 1980s as governments have tried to obtain some of the benefits of the private sector without going as far as full privatisation. The gains have been greatest when services have been allocated to private firms through competitive bidding. They have been smallest, and arguably even negative, in cases when the main contribution of the private firm has been to raise finance. That is because governments can usually borrow more cheaply than private firms, so when they ask them to raise money the question that springs to mind is: are they doing this to make their public borrowing look smaller?"
Q theory,See TOBIN.
Quantity theory of money,The foundation stone of MONETARISM. The theory says that the quantity of MONEY available in an economy determines the value of money. Increases in the MONEY SUPPLY are the main cause of INFLATION. This is why Milton FRIEDMAN claimed that 'inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon'.
Queueing,"Market failure? Not necessarily. Usually a queue reflects a PRICE that is set too low, so that DEMAND exceeds SUPPLY, so some customers have to wait to buy the product. But a queue may also be the result of deliberate rationing by a producer, perhaps to attract attention - by a restaurant that wants to appear popular, say. Customers may regard a queue, such as a waiting list for health treatment, as a fairer way to distribute the product than using the PRICE MECHANISM."
R squared,An indicator of the reliability of a relationship identified by REGRESSION ANALYSIS. An R2 of 0.8 indicates that 80% of the change in one variable is explained by a change in the related variable.
Random walk,"Impossible to predict the next step. EFFICIENT MARKET THEORY says that the PRICES of many financial ASSETS, such as SHARES, follow a random walk. In other words, there is no way of knowing whether the next change in the price will be up or down, or by how much it will rise or fall. The reason is that in an efficient market, all the INFORMATION that would allow an investor to predict the next price move is already reflected in the current price. This belief has led some economists to argue that investors cannot consistently outperform the market. But some economists argue that asset prices are predictable (they follow a non-random walk) and that markets are not efficient."
Rate of return,"A way to measure economic success, albeit one that can be manipulated quite easily. It is calculated by expressing the economic gain (usually PROFIT) as a percentage of the CAPITAL used to produce it. Deciding what number to use for profit is rarely simple. Likewise, totalling up how much capital was used can be tricky, especially if it is expanded to include INTANGIBLE ASSETS and HUMAN CAPITAL. When FIRMS are evaluating a project to decide whether to go ahead with it, they estimate the project's expected rate of return and compare it with their COST OF CAPITAL. (See NET PRESENT VALUE and DISCOUNT RATE.)"
Rate of return regulation,"An approach to REGULATION often used for a PUBLIC UTILITY to stop it exploiting MONOPOLY power. A public utility is forbidden to earn above a certain RATE OF RETURN decided by the regulator. In practice, this often encourages the utility to be inefficient, slow to innovate and quick to spend money on such things as big offices and executive jets, to keep down its PROFIT and thus the rate of return. Contrast with PRICE       REGULATION."
Ratings,"A guide to the riskiness of a FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT provided by a ratings agency, such as Moody's, Standard and Poor's and Fitch IBCA. These measures of CREDIT quality are mostly offered on marketable GOVERNMENT and corporate DEBT. A triple-A or A++ rating represents a low risk of DEFAULT; a C or D rating an extreme risk of, or actual, default. Debt PRICES and YIELDS often (but not always) reflect these ratings. A triple-A BOND has a low yield. High-yielding bonds, also known as junk bonds, usually have a rating that suggests a high risk of default."
Rational expectations,"How some economists believe that people think about the future. Nobody can predict the future perfectly; but rational expectations theory assumes that, over time, unexpected events (SHOCKS) will cancel out each other and that on average people's expectations about the future will be accurate. This is because they form their expectations on a rational basis, using all the INFORMATION available to them optimally, and learn from their mistakes. This is in contrast to other theories of how people look ahead, such as ADAPTIVE EXPECTATIONS, in which people base their predictions on past trends and changes in trends, and BEHAVIOURAL ECONOMICS, which assumes that expectations are somewhat irrational as a result of psychological biases."
Rationality,See ECONOMIC MAN.
Real balance effect,Falling INFLATION and INTEREST rates lead to higher spending (see WEALTH EFFECT).
Real options theory,"A newish theory of how to take INVESTMENT decisions when the future is uncertain, which draws parallels between the real economy and the use and valuation of financial options. It is becoming increasingly fashionable at business schools and even in the boardroom."
Real terms,A measure of the value of MONEY that removes the effect of INFLATION. Contrast with NOMINAL VALUE.
Reciprocity,"Doing as you are done by. A grants B certain privileges on the condition that B grants the same privileges to A. Most international economic agreements, for example, on trade, include binding reciprocity requirements."
Reflation,Policies to pump up DEMAND and thus boost the level of economic activity. Monetarists fear that such policies may simply result in higher INFLATION.
Regional policy,"A policy intended to boost economic activity in a specific geographical area that is not an entire country and, typically, is in worse economic shape than nearby areas. It can include offering FIRMS incentives to provide jobs in the region, such as SOFT LOANS, grants, lower taxes, cheap LAND and buildings, subsidised LABOUR and worker training. Is it necessary? A region's problems should be somewhat self-correcting. After all, simple theories of SUPPLY and DEMAND would suggest that firms will move to areas of low WAGES and high UNEMPLOYMENT to take advantage of cheaper labour and surplus workers, or that workers will move away from such areas to where more and better-paid jobs exist. But some economic theories suggest that rather than moving to areas where wages are lowest, firms often cluster together with other successful businesses. Regional policy may need to be extremely generous to tempt firms to give up the advantages of being in a cluster."
Regression analysis,"Number-crunching to discover the relationship between different economic variables. The findings of this statistical technique should always be taken with a pinch of salt. How big a pinch can vary considerably and is indicated by the degree of STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE and R SQUARED. The relationship between a dependent variable (GDP, say) and a set of explanatory variables (DEMAND, INTEREST rates, CAPITAL, UNEMPLOYMENT, and so on) is expressed as a regression equation."
Regulatory arbitrage,"Exploiting loopholes in REGULATION, and perhaps making the regulation useless in the process. This is often done by international investors that use DERIVATIVES to find ways around a country’s financial regulations."
Regulatory capture,"Gamekeeper turns poacher or, at least, helps poacher. The theory of regulatory capture was set out by Richard Posner, an economist and lawyer at the University of Chicago, who argued that “REGULATION is not about the public interest at all, but is a process, by which interest groups seek to promote their private interest ... Over time, regulatory agencies come to be dominated by the industries regulated.” Most economists are less extreme, arguing that regulation often does good but is always at RISK of being captured by the regulated firms."
Regulatory failure,When REGULATION generates more economic costs than benefits.
Regulatory risk,"A RISK faced by private-sector FIRMS that regulatory changes will hurt their business. In competitive markets, regulatory risk is usually small. But in NATURAL MONOPOLY industries, such as electricity distribution, it may be huge. To ensure that regulatory risk does not deter private firms from offering their services, a GOVERNMENT wishing to change its regulations may have good reason to compensate private firms that suffer losses as a result of the change."
Relative income hypothesis,"People often care more about their relative well being than their absolute well being. Someone who prefers a $100 a week pay rise when a colleague gets $50 to both of them getting a $200 increase, for example. Poor people may consume more of their INCOME than rich people do because they want to reduce the gap in their CONSUMPTION levels. The relative income hypothesis, set out by James Duesenberry, says that a household's consumption depends partly on its income relative to other families. Contrast with PERMANENT INCOME HYPOTHESIS."
Rent-seeking,"Cutting yourself a bigger slice of the cake rather than making the cake bigger. Trying to make more money without producing more for customers. Classic examples of rent-seeking, a phrase coined by an economist, Gordon Tullock, include:"
Replacement cost,What it would cost today to replace a FIRM's existing ASSETS.
Replacement rate,"The fertility rate required in a country to keep its population steady. In rich countries, this is usually reckoned to be 2.1 children per woman, the extra 0.1 reflecting the likelihood that some children will die before their parents. In poorer countries with higher infant mortality, the replacement rate may be much higher. In may countries, since the early 1990s the fertility rate has fallen below the replacement rate. There has been much debate about why, and much agreement that, if this trend continues, those countries may face long-term problems such as a relatively growing proportion of retired older people having to be supported by a relatively shrinking proportion of younger people."
Required return,The minimum EXPECTED RETURN you require from an INVESTMENT to be willing to go ahead with it.
Rescheduling,Changing the payment schedule for a DEBT by agreement between borrower and lender. This is usually done when the borrower is struggling to make payments under the original schedule. Rescheduling can involve reducing INTEREST ­payments but extending the period over which they are collected; putting back the date of repayment of the loan; reducing interest payments but increasing the amount that has to be repaid eventually; and so on. The rescheduling may or may not require the lender to bear some financial loss. The rescheduling may or may not require the lender to bear some financial loss. The rescheduling of loans to countries usually takes place through the Paris Club and London Club.
Reservation wage,The lowest WAGE for which a person will work.
Reserve currency,A foreign currency held by a GOVERNMENT or CENTRAL BANK as part of a country’s RESERVES. Outside the United States the dollar is the most widely used reserve currency. Everywhere the EURO is increasingly widely used.
Reserve ratio,The fraction of its deposits that a BANK holds as RESERVES.
Reserve requirements,Regulations governing the minimum amount of RESERVES that a BANK must hold against deposits.
Reserves,"MONEY in the hand, available to be used to meet planned future payments or if some other need arises. FIRMS may put their reserves in a BANK, as a deposit. For a bank, reserves are those deposits it retains rather than lending them out."
Residual risk,"When you buy an ASSET you become exposed to a bundle of different RISKs. Many of these risks are not unique to the asset you own but reflect broader possibilities, such as that the stockmarket average will rise or fall, that INTEREST rates will be cut or increased, or that the GROWTH rate will change in an entire economy or industry. Residual  risk, also known as alpha, is what is left after you take out all the other shared risk exposures. Exposure to this risk can be reduced by DIVERSIFICATION. Contrast with SYSTEMATIC RISK."
Restrictive practice,"A general term for anything done by a firm, or FIRMS, to inhibit COMPETITION. Generally against the law. (See ANTITRUST and CARTEL.)"
Returns,The rewards for doing business. Returns usually refer to PROFIT and can be measured in various ways (see RATE OF RETURN and TOTAL RETURNS).
Revealed preference,"An example of a popular joke among economists: two economists see a Ferrari. 'I want one of those,' says the first. 'Obviously not,' replies the other. To get a smile out of this it is necessary (but not, alas, sufficient) to know about revealed preference. This is the notion that what you want is revealed by what you do, not by what you say. Actions speak louder than words. If the economist had really wanted a Ferrari he would have tried to buy one, if he did not own one already."
"Ricardo, David","The third of 17 children of a wealthy banker, David Ricardo (1772-1823) was disinherited at the age of 21 after he married a Quaker against the wishes of his parents. He became a stockbroker and did so well that he retired at 42 to concentrate on writing and politics."
Risk averse,"Someone who thinks RISK is a four-letter word. Risk-averse investors are those who, when faced with two investments with the same EXPECTED RETURN but two different risks, prefer the one with the lower risk."
Risk management,"The process of bearing the RISK you want to bear, and minimising your exposure to the risk you do not want. This can be done in several ways: not doing things that carry a particular risk; HEDGING; DIVERSIFICATION; and buying INSURANCE."
Risk neutral,Someone who is insensitive to RISK. Risk-neutral investors are indifferent between an INVESTMENT with a certain outcome and a risky investment with the same EXPECTED RETURNS but an uncertain outcome. Such people are few and far between.
Risk premium,The extra RETURN that investors require to hold a risky ASSET instead of a risk-free one; the difference between the EXPECTED RETURNS from a risky INVESTMENT and the risk-free rate. (See EQUITY RISK PREMIUM.)
Risk seeking,Someone who cannot get enough RISK. ­Risk-seeking investors prefer an INVESTMENT with an uncertain outcome to one with the same EXPECTED RETURNS and certainty that it will deliver them.
Risk-free rate,"The RATE OF RETURN earned on a risk-free ASSET. This is a crucial component of MODERN PORTFOLIO theory, which assumes the existence of both risky and risk-free assets. The risk-free asset is usually assumed to be a GOVERNMENT BOND, and the risk-free rate is the YIELD on that bond, although in fact even a Treasury is not entirely without risk. In modern portfolio theory, the risk-free rate is lower than the EXPECTED RETURN on the risky asset, because the issuer of the risky asset has to offer RISK AVERSE investors the expectation of a higher return to persuade them to forgo the risk-free asset."
Safe harbour,Protection from the rough seas of REGULATION. Laws and regulations often include a safe harbour clause that sets out the circumstances in which otherwise regulated FIRMS or individuals can do something without regulatory oversight or interference.
Satisficing,"Settling for what is good enough, rather than the best that is possible. This may occur in any situation in which decision makers are trying to pursue more than one goal at a time. CLASSICAL ECONOMICS and NEO-CLASSICAL ECONOMICS assume that individuals, FIRMS and GOVERNMENTS try to achieve the OPTIMUM, best possible outcome from their decisions. Satisficing assumes they decide for each goal a level of achievement that would be good enough and try to find a way to achieve all of these sub-optimal goals at once. This approach to decision making is commonplace in behavioural economics. It can be regarded as a realist's theory of how decisions are taken. The concept was invented by Herbert Simon (1916-2001), a Nobel ­prize-winning economist, in his book, Models of Man, in 1957."
Savings,"Any INCOME that is not spent. Ultimately, savings are the source of INVESTMENT in an economy, although domestic savings may be supplemented by CAPITAL from foreign savers or themselves be invested abroad."
Say's law,"SUPPLY creates its own DEMAND. So argued a French economist, Jean-Baptiste Say (1767-1832), and many classical and neo-classical economists since. KEYNES argued against Say, making the case for the use of FISCAL POLICY to boost demand if there is not enough of it to produce FULL EMPLOYMENT."
Scenario analysis,"Testing your plans against various possible scenarios to see what might happen should things not go as you hope. Scenario analysis is an important technique in RISK MANAGEMENT, helping FIRMS and especially financial institutions to ensure that they do not take on too much RISK. Its usefulness does of course depend on risk managers coming up with the right scenarios."
"Schumpeter, Joseph","After growing up in the Austro-Hungarian empire, in which he worked as an itinerant lawyer, Joseph Schumpeter (1883-1950) became an academic in 1909. He was appointed Austrian minister of finance in 19 19, presiding over a period of HYPER-INFLATION. He then became president of a small Viennese BANK, which collapsed. He returned to academia in Bonn in 1925 and in the 1930s joined the faculty of Harvard."
SDR,"Short for special drawing rights. Created in 1967, the SDR is the IMF's own currency. Its value is based on a portfolio of widely used currencies."
Search costs,"The cost of finding what you want. The economic cost of buying something is not simply the PRICE you pay. Finding what you want and ensuring that it is competitively priced can be expensive, be it the financial cost of physically getting to a marketplace or the OPPORTUNITY COST of time spent fact-finding. Search costs mean that people often take decisions without all the relevant INFORMATION, which can result in inefficiency. Technological changes such as the internet may sharply reduce search costs, and thus lead to more efficient decision making."
Seasonally adjusted,"There are seasonal patterns in many economic activities; for instance, there is less construction in winter than in summer, and spending in shops soars as Christmas approaches. To reveal underlying trends, statistics reflecting only part of the year are often adjusted to iron out seasonal variations."
Second-best theory,"As we do not live in a perfect world, how useful are economic theories based on the assumption  that we do? Second-best theory, set out in 1956 by Richard Lipsey and Kelvin Lancaster (1924-99), looks at what happens when the assumptions of an economic model are not fully met. They found that in situations where not all the conditions are met, the second-best situation - that is, meeting as many of the other conditions as possible - may not result in the OPTIMUM solution. Indeed, reckoned Lipsey and Lancaster, in general, when one optimal equilibrium condition is not satisfied all of the other equilibrium conditions will change."
Secondary market,"A market in second-hand FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. BONDS and SHARES are first sold in the primary market, for instance, through an initial public offering. After that, their new owners often sell them in the secondary market. The existence of liquid secondary markets can encourage people to buy in the primary market, as they know they are likely to be able to sell easily should they wish."
Securitisation,"Turning a future cashflow into tradable, BOND-like SECURITIES. Creating such ASSET-backed securities became a lucrative business for financial FIRMS during the 1990s, as they invented new securities based on cashflow ranging from future mortgage and credit-card payments to BANK loans, movie revenue and even the royalties on songs by David Bowie (so-called Bowie-bonds). Securitisation has many benefits, at least in­theory. Issuers gain instant access to MONEY for which they would otherwise have to wait months or years, and they can shed some of the RISK that their expected revenue will not materialise. By selling securitised loans, investment banks are able to finance their customers without tying up large amounts of CAPITAL. Investors can hold a new sort of asset, less risky than unsecured bonds, giving them the risk-reducing benefit of DIVERSIFICATION. But there are dangers. The future cashflow underlying the securities may flow earlier or later than promised, or not at all."
Seignorage,"Traditionally, the PROFIT rulers made from allowing metals to be turned into coins. Now it refers in a loosely defined way to the power of a country whose notes and coins are held by another country as a RESERVE CURRENCY."
Seller's market,A market in which the seller seems to have the upper hand and so can charge a higher PRICE than in a BUYER'S MARKET.
Seniority,"The order in which CREDITORS are entitled to be repaid. In the event of a BANKRUPTCY, senior DEBT must be paid off before junior debt. Because junior debt has a lower chance of being repaid than senior debt, it carries more RISK, and thus typically pays a higher YIELD."
Sequencing,"Shorthand for implementing economic reforms in the right order. In recent years, this has become a hot topic in development economics. Some economists argue that introducing the right policies alone is not enough to revive a malfunctioning economy; reforms must be implemented in the right sequence. Thus they debate when in the reform process there should be, say, privatisation of state enterprises, and in which order, or the lifting of capital controls or other trade barriers. Other economists dispute whether there is a right sequence."
Services,"Products of economic activity that you can’t drop on your foot, ranging from hairdressing to websites. In most countries, the share of economic activity accounted for by services rose steadily during the 20th century at the expense of AGRICULTURE and MANUFACTURING. More than two-thirds of OUTPUT in OECD countries, and up to four-fifths of employment, is now in the services sector."
Shadow price,"The true economic PRICE of an activity: the OPPORTUNITY COST. Shadow prices can be calculated for those goods and SERVICES that do not have a market price, perhaps because they are set by GOVERNMENT. Shadow pricing is often used in COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS, where the whole purpose of the analysis is to capture all the variables involved in a decision, not merely those for which market prices exist."
Shareholder value,"Putting shareholders first; the notion that all business activity should aim to maximise the total value of a company’s SHARES. Some critics argue that concentrating on shareholder value will be harmful to a company’s other STAKEHOLDERS, such as employees, suppliers and customers."
Sharpe ratio,"A rough guide to whether the rewards from an INVESTMENT justify the RISK, invented by Bill Sharpe, a winner of the NOBEL PRIZE FOR ECONOMICS and co-creator of the CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL. You simply divide the past  RETURN on the investment (less the RISK-FREE RATE) by its STANDARD DEVIATION, the simplest measure of risk. The higher the Sharpe ratio is the better, that is, the greater is the return per unit of risk. However, as it is a backward-looking measure, based on what an investment has done in the past, the Sharpe ratio does not guarantee similar performance in future."
Shock,An unexpected event that affects an economy (see ASYMMETRIC SHOCK).
Short-termism,"Doing things that make you better off in the short-run but worse off in the end. After the bursting of the stockmarket bubble and the failure of Enron at the start of the 2000s, much like during the 1980s, accusations of short-termism were often made against the stockmarket-focused CAPITALISM of the United States and the UK. During the bubble, it was claimed, investors had become too focused on short-term profits and changes in share prices, and failed to probe deeply enough into long-term performance. As a result, managers did things that made their profits look as good as possible in the short run, often to the detriment of their company's long-term health. Indeed, many firms engaged in misleading and even fraudulent accounting practices to inflate short-term profits. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the complaint took a slightly different form, and was arguably less convincing, namely that short-termism caused lower levels of INVESTMENT by businesses than in countries where the stockmarket was less important, such as Germany and Japan."
Shorting,"Selling a SECURITY, such as a SHARE, that you do not currently own, in the expectation that its PRICE will fall by the time the security has to be delivered to its new owner. If the price does fall, you can buy the security at the lower price, deliver it to whoever you sold it to and make a PROFIT. The RISK is that the price rises, leaving you with a loss."
Signalling,"A solution to one of the biggest sources of MARKET FAILURE: ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION. Often the biggest problem facing sellers is how to convince buyers that what they are selling is as good as they say it is. This problem arises in situations where the qualities of the thing being sold cannot be observed easily by buyers, who thus fear that sellers may be conning them. In such situations, an answer may be for sellers to do something that shows they mean what they say about quality. This something is what economists call signalling."
Simple interest,INTEREST calculated only on the initial amount ­borrowed or invested. Contrast with COMPOUND INTEREST.
"Smith, Adam","The founder of ECONOMICS as we know it. Born in Kirkcaldy, Fife, Adam Smith (1723-90) was educated at Glasgow and Oxford, and in 1751 became professor of logic at Glasgow University. Eight years later he made his name by publishing the THEORY OF MORAL SENTIMENTS. His 1776 book, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, is the bible of CLASSICAL ECONOMICS. He emphasised the role of specialisation (the DIVISION OF LABOUR), TECHNICAL PROGRESS and CAPITAL INVESTMENT as the main engines of economic GROWTH. Above all, he stressed the importance of the INVISIBLE HAND, the way in which self-interest pursued in free markets leads to the most efficient use of economic resources and makes everybody better off in the process."
Social benefits/costs,The overall impact of an economic activity on the WELFARE of society. Social benefits/costs are the sum of private benefits/costs arising from the activity and any EXTERNALITIES.
Social capital,"The amount of community spirit or trust that an economy has gluing it together. The more social capital there is, the more productive the economy will be. Yet, curiously, one of the best-known books to address the role of social capital, ""Bowling Alone"", by Robert Putnam of Harvard University, pointed out that Americans were far less likely to be members of community organisations, clubs or associations in the 1990s than they were in the 1950s. He illustrated his thesis by charting the decline of bowling leagues. Yet the American economy has gone from strength to strength. This has led some economists to question whether social capital is really as important as the theory suggests, and others to argue that membership of bowling leagues and other community organisations is simply not a good indicator of the amount of social capital in a country."
Social market,"The name given to the economic arrangements devised in Germany after the second world war. This blended market CAPITALISM, strong LABOUR protection and union influence, and a generous WELFARE state. The phrase has also been used to describe attempts to make capitalism more caring, and to the use of market mechanisms to increase the EFFICIENCY of the social functions of the state, such as the education system or prisons. More broadly, it refers to the study of the different social institutions underpinning every market economy."
Soft currency,A currency that is expected to drop in value relative to other currencies.
Soft dollars,The value of research services that brokerage companies provide “free” to INVESTMENT managers in exchange for the investment managers’ business. Economists disagree on whether or not such hidden payments are economically inefficient.
Soft loan,A loan provided at below the market INTEREST RATE. Soft loans are used by international agencies to encourage economic activity in DEVELOPING COUNTRIES and to support non-commercial activities.
Sovereign risk,The RISK that a GOVERNMENT will default on its DEBT or on a loan guaranteed by it.
Speculative motive,See PRECAUTIONARY MOTIVE.
Spot price,"The PRICE quoted for a transaction that is to be made on the spot, that is, paid for now for delivery now. Contrast spot markets with FORWARD CONTRACTS and futures markets, where payment and/or delivery will be made at some future date. Also contrast with long-term contracts, in which a price is agreed for repeated transactions over an extended time period and which may not involve immediate payment in full."
Spread,The difference between one item and another. A much used term in FINANCIAL MARKETS. Examples are the differences between:
Stabilisation,"GOVERNMENT policies intended to smooth the economic cycle, expanding DEMAND when UNEMPLOYMENT is high and reducing it when INFLATION threatens to increase. Doing this by FINE TUNING has mostly proved harder than KEYNESIAN policymakers expected, and it has become unfashionable. However, the use of automatic stabilisers remains widespread. For instance, social handouts from the state usually increase during tough times, and taxes increase (FISCAL DRAG), boosting government revenue, when the economy is growing."
Stability and Growth Pact,"Budgetary rules agreed to by Euro Zone countries as a condition of joining the euro. The pact stipulates that all the countries will run a balanced budget in normal times. A government that runs a fiscal deficit bigger than 3% of GDP must take swift corrective action. And if any country breaches the 3% limit for more than three years in a row, it becomes liable to fines of billions of euros. The pact was supposed to be a powerful political symbol that euro-using countries would not cheat each other. However, Portugal became the first country to break the deficit limit by notching up 4.1% in 2001. When, in 2002, France and Germany also exceeded the 3% limit, some EU members were outraged and others lobbied for the pact to be modified or even scrapped."
Stakeholders,"All the parties that have an interest, financial or otherwise, in a company, including shareholders, CREDITORS, bondholders, employees, customers, management, the community and GOVERNMENT. How these different interests should be catered for, and what to do when they conflict, is much debated. In particular, there is growing disagreement between those who argue that companies should be run primarily in the interests of their shareholders, in order to maximise shareholder value, and those who argue that the wishes of shareholders should sometimes be traded off against those of other stakeholders."
Standard deviation,A measure of how far a variable moves over time away from its AVERAGE (mean) value.
Standard error,A measure of the possible error in a statistical estimate.
Statistical significance,"There are lies, damned lies and statistics, said Benjamin Disraeli, a British prime minister. Certainly, even if the result of number crunching is statistically significant, it does not actually mean it is true. But it does mean it is much more likely to be true than false. Statistical significance means that the PROBABILITY of getting that result by chance is low. The most commonly used measure of statistical significance is that there must be a 95% chance that the result is right and only a 1 in 20 chance of the result occurring randomly."
Sterilised intervention,"When a GOVERNMENT or CENTRAL BANK buys or sells some of its RESERVES of foreign currency this can affect the country’s MONEY        SUPPLY. Selling reserves decreases the supply of the domestic currency; buying reserves increases the domestic money supply. Governments or central banks can sterilise (that is, cancel out) this effect of foreign exchange intervention on the money supply by buying or selling an equivalent amount of SECURITIES. For example, if the GOVERNMENT increases reserves by buying foreign currency the domestic money supply will increase, unless it sells securities such as TREASURY BILLS to mop up the extra DEMAND."
Sticky prices,"Petrol-pump PRICES do not change every time the oil price changes, and holiday prices and standard hotel rates are fixed for months. Sticky prices are slow to change in response to changes in SUPPLY or DEMAND. As a result there is, at least temporarily, DISEQUILIBRIUM in the market. The causes of stickiness include MENU COSTS, inadequate information, consumers' dislike of frequent price changes and long-term contracts with fixed prices. Prices change only when the cost of leaving them unchanged exceeds the expense of adjusting them. In FINANCIAL MARKETS, prices move all the time because the cost of quoting the wrong price can be huge. In other industries, the penalty may be much less severe. Small disequilibria in, say, the pricing of hotel rooms will not make much difference. So hotel prices are often sticky."
Stochastic process,"A process that exhibits random behaviour. For instance, Brownian motion, which is often used to describe changes in SHARE prices in an EFFICIENT MARKET (the RANDOM WALK), is a stochastic process."
Stress-testing,A process for exploring how a portfolio of ASSETS and/or liabilities would fare in extreme adverse conditions. A useful tool in RISK MANAGEMENT.
Structural adjustment,"A programme of policies designed to change the structure of an economy. Usually, the term refers to adjustment towards a market economy, under a programme approved by the IMF and/or WORLD BANK, which often supply structural adjustment funds to ease the pain of transition. Such policies are much criticised in the developing world, sometimes with good reason."
Structural unemployment,"The hardest sort of UNEMPLOYMENT to cure because it is caused by the structure of an economy rather than by changes in the economic cycle. Contrast with cyclical unemployment, which can, in theory  if not always in practice, be cut without sparking INFLATION by stimulating faster economic GROWTH. Structural unemployment can be reduced only by changing the economic structures causing it, for instance, by removing rules that limit LABOUR MARKET FLEXIBILITY."
Substitute goods,"Goods for which an increase (or fall) in DEMAND for one leads to a fall (or increase) in demand for the other – Coca-Cola and Pepsi, perhaps."
Sunk costs,"When what is done cannot be undone. Sunk costs are costs that have been incurred and cannot be reversed, for example, spending on ADVERTISING or researching a product idea. They can be a barrier to entry. If potential entrants would have to incur similar costs, which would not be recoverable if the entry failed, they may be scared off."
Supply curve,A graph of the relationship between the PRICE of a good and the amount supplied at different prices. (See also DEMAND CURVE.)
Supply-side policies,"Increasing economic GROWTH by making markets work more efficiently. In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher championed supply-side policies as they attacked KEYNESIAN         DEMAND management. Pumping up demand without making markets work better would simply lead to higher INFLATION; economic growth would increase only when markets were able to operate more freely. Thus they pursued policies of DEREGULATION, LIBERALISATION and PRIVATISATION and encouraged FREE TRADE. To reduce UNEMPLOYMENT, they tried to increase the EFFICIENCY of the jobs market by cutting the rate of INCOME TAX and attacking legal  and other impediments to LABOUR MARKET FLEXIBILITY. The results of these programmes are much debated. In particular, the belief, apparently supported by the LAFFER CURVE, that cutting tax rates would increase tax revenue did not always stand up well to real-world testing. Even so, it is now recognised that supply-side reforms are a crucial element in an effective economic policy."
Sustainable growth,"A term much used by environmentalists, meaning economic GROWTH that can continue in the long term without non-renewable resources being used up or pollution becoming intolerable. Mainstream economists use the term, too, to describe a rate of growth that an economy can sustain indefinitely without causing a rise in INFLATION."
Systematic risk,"The RISK that remains after DIVERSIFICATION, also known as market risk or undiversifiable risk. It is systematic risk that determines the RETURN earned on a well-diversified portfolio of ASSETS."
Systemic risk,"The RISK of damage being done to the health of the FINANCIAL SYSTEM as a whole. A constant concern of BANK regulators is that the collapse of a single bank could bring down the entire financial system. This is why regulators often organise a rescue when a bank gets into financial difficulties. However, the expectation of such a rescue may create a MORAL HAZARD, encouraging banks to behave in ways that increase systemic risk. Another concern of regulators is that the ­RISK MANAGEMENT methods used by banks are so similar that they may increase systemic risk by creating a tendency for crowd behaviour. In particular, problems in one market may cause banks in general to liquidate positions in other markets, causing a vicious cycle of LIQUIDITY being withdrawn from the financial system as everybody rushes for the emergency exit at once. (See CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL.)"
Tax arbitrage,"Creating FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS or transactions that allow the parties involved to exploit loopholes in or differences between their tax exposures, so that all involved pay less tax."
Tax avoidance,"Doing everything possible within the law to reduce your tax bill. Learned Hand, an American judge, once said: “There is nothing sinister in so arranging one’s affairs as to keep taxes as low as possible … nobody owes any public duty to pay more than the law demands.” Contrast with TAX EVASION."
Tax base,"The thing or amount to which a tax rate applies. To collect INCOME TAX, for example, you need a meaningful definition of INCOME. Definitions of the tax base can vary enormously, over time and among countries, especially when tax breaks are taken into account. As a result, a country with a comparatively high tax rate may not have a high TAX BURDEN if it has a more narrowly defined tax base than other countries. In recent years, the political unpopularity of high tax rates has lead many governments to lower rates and at the same time broaden the tax base, often leaving the tax burden unchanged."
Tax burden,"Total tax paid in a period as a proportion of total INCOME in that period. It can refer to personal, corporate or national income."
Tax competition,"Low-tax policies pursued by some countries in the hope of attracting international businesses and CAPITAL. Economists usually favour COMPETITION in any form. But some say that tax competition is often a beggar-thy-neighbour policy, which can reduce another country's TAX BASE, or force it to change its mix of taxes, or stop it taxing in the way it would like."
Tax efficient,"From the point of view of the taxpayer, the way of undertaking an economic activity that results in the lowest (legitimate) tax bill."
Tax evasion,"Paying less tax than you are legally obliged to. Contrast with TAX AVOIDANCE. There may be a thin line between the two, but as Denis Healey, a former British chancellor, once put it, “The difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion is the thickness of a prison wall.”"
Tax haven,"A country or designated zone that has low or no taxes, or highly secretive BANKS, and often a warm climate and sandy beaches, which make it attractive to foreigners bent on TAX AVOIDANCE or even TAX EVASION."
Technical progress,"A crucial ingredient of economic GROWTH. Economists often used to take a certain rate of technological progress for granted, but in new ENDOGENOUS growth theory they make more effort to measure accurately and better understand what causes differences in the rate of technical change."
Third way,"An economic philosophy espoused by some leftish political leaders in the late 20th century, including Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. According to the rhetoric, it is not CAPITALISM and not SOCIALISM, but a third (pragmatic) way. Many have therefore found it rather hard to pin down. It was earlier used to describe Sweden’s economic model."
Tiger economies,"The fast-growing developing economies of Asia, at least before their crisis in the late 1990s."
Time series,"Several measurements of a variable taken at regular intervals, such as daily, monthly, quarterly, and so on. They are often used by economists in search of trends that they hope will let them predict future movements in the variable."
Time value of money,"The idea that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future, because the dollar in the hand today can earn INTEREST during the time until the future dollar is received."
"Tobin, James","A Nobel prize-winning economist, James Tobin (1918-2002) theorised that FIRMS would continue to invest as long as the value of their SHARES exceeded the replacement cost of their ASSETS. The ratio of the market value of a firm to the net REPLACEMENT COST of the firm's assets is known as 'Tobin's Q'. If Q is greater than 1, then it should pay the firm to expand, as the PROFIT it should expect to make from its assets (reflected in the share PRICE) exceeds the cost of the assets. If Q is less than 1, the firm would be better off selling its assets, which are worth more than shareholders currently expect the firm to earn in profit by retaining them."
Trade,See FREE TRADE.
Trade area,"In a globalising economy, it is perhaps surprising that countries increasingly trade with their nearest neighbours. One explanation is geography: as countries have lowered their TARIFF barriers, the relatively greater importance of transport costs makes proximity matter more. According to NEW TRADE THEORY, this also produces gains from ECONOMIES OF SCALE. But another reason for the fast growth in trade among nearby countries may be less benign. The proliferation of regional trade agreements may be causing neighbours to trade with each other when it would be more efficient for them to export to and import from afar."
Trade cycle,See BUSINESS CYCLE.
Trade deficit/surplus,An excess of IMPORTS over EXPORTS is a trade deficit. An excess of exports over imports is a trade surplus. (See BALANCE OF PAYMENTS.)
Trade unions,See UNIONS.
Trade-weighted exchange rate,A country’s EXCHANGE RATE with the currencies of its trading partners weighted by the amount of trade done by the country in each currency.
Tragedy of the commons,"A 19th-century amateur mathematician, William Forster Lloyd, modelled the fate of a common pasture shared among rational, UTILITY-maximising herdsmen. He showed that as the POPULATION increased the pasture would inevitably be destroyed. This tragedy may be the fate of all sorts of common resources, because no individual, firm or group has meaningful PROPERTY RIGHTS that would make them think twice about using so much of it that it is destroyed."
Transaction costs,"The costs incurred during the process of buying or selling, on top of the PRICE of whatever is changing hands. If these costs can be reduced, the PRICE MECHANISM will operate more efficiently."
Transfer pricing,"The PRICES assumed, for the purposes of calculating tax liability, to have been charged by one unit of a multinational company when selling to another (foreign) unit of the same firm. FIRMS spend a fortune on advisers to help them set their transfer prices so that they minimise their total tax bill. For instance, by charging low transfer prices from a unit based in a high-tax country that is selling to a unit in a low-tax country, a firm can record a low PROFIT in the first country and a high profit in the second. In theory, however, transfer prices are supposed to be set according to the arm's-length principle: that they should be the same as would be charged if the sale was to a business unconnected in any way to the selling firm. But when there is no genuinely independent market with which to compare transfer prices, what an arm's length price would be can be a matter of great debate and an opportunity for firms that want to lower their tax bill."
Transfers,"Payments that are made without any good or service being received in return. Much PUBLIC SPENDING goes on transfers, such as pensions and WELFARE benefits. Private-sector transfers include charitable donations and prizes to lottery winners."
Transition economies,"Former communist economies that, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, have embraced CAPITALISM."
Transmission mechanism,The process by which changes in the MONEY SUPPLY affect the level of total DEMAND in an economy.
Treasury bills,A form of short-term GOVERNMENT         DEBT. Treasury bills usually mature after three months. They are used for managing fluctuations in the government’s short-run cash needs. Most government borrowing takes the form of longer-term BONDS.
Uncertainty,See information.
Underground economy,See BLACK ECONOMY.
Unemployment trap,"When unemployed people who receive benefits, either from the GOVERNMENT or from private CHARITY, are deterred from taking a new job because the reduction or removal of benefit if they do will make them worse off. Also known as the POVERTY TRAP, it can be addressed, to an extent, by continuing to pay benefit for a while to unemployed people returning to work. (See WELFARE TO WORK.)"
Unions,"In developed countries, at least, trade union membership and influence has declined over the past three decades. Fewer WAGES are now set by collective bargaining, and far fewer working days are lost to strikes. Unions, which are in effect a CARTEL of workers, probably make UNEMPLOYMENT higher than it would be without them, as collective bargaining often pushes wages above the level that would bring LABOUR SUPPLY and DEMAND into EQUILIBRIUM. These higher wages increase supply and reduce demand, with the result that there are more jobless people. Unions thus deepen a conflict between those in the labour market who are insiders, that is, union members, and those who are outsiders, typically non-unionised, poorly paid or jobless people. However, unions can combat the excessive market power of some FIRMS, particularly when the firms (or a GOVERNMENT) dominate a particular job market. They can support workers who are badly treated by management. They may sometimes provide an efficient, and thus valuable, channel for communication between workers and managers, particularly in countries such as Germany, where conflict between management and unions is viewed as unhealthy."
Value at risk,"Value at risk models, widely used for RISK MANAGEMENT by BANKS and other financial institutions, use complex computer algorithms to calculate the maximum that the institution could lose in a single day's trading. These models seem to work well in normal conditions but not, alas, during financial crises, which is arguably when it is most necessary to know how much value is at RISK."
Variable costs,"Part of a firm’s production costs that changes according to how much OUTPUT it produces. Contrast with FIXED COSTS. Examples include some purchases of raw materials and workers’ overtime payments. In the long run, most costs can be varied."
Velocity of circulation,"The speed with which MONEY whizzes around the economy, or, put another way, the number of times it changes hands. Technically, it is measured as GNP divided by the MONEY SUPPLY (pick your own definition). It is an important ingredient of the QUANTITY THEORY OF MONEY."
Venture capital,"PRIVATE EQUITY to help new companies grow. A valuable alternative source of finance for ENTREPRENEURS, who might otherwise have to rely on a loan from a probably RISK AVERSE bank manager. The United States has by far the world's biggest venture capital industry. Some economists reckon that this is why more innovative new firms have become successful there. As legend has it, with a bright idea, a garage to work in and some venture capital, anybody can create a Microsoft. However, the bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2000 threw American venture capital into a severe recession, damaging its reputation for financing profitable innovation."
Visible trade,"Physical EXPORTS and IMPORTS, such as coal, computer chips and cars. Also known as merchandise trade. Contrast with INVISIBLE TRADE. (See BALANCE OF PAYMENTS.)"
Voluntary unemployment,"Unemployment through opting not to work, even though there are jobs available. This is the joblessness that remains when there is otherwise FULL EMPLOYMENT. It includes FRICTIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT as a result of people changing jobs, people not working while they undertake JOB SEARCH and ­people who just do not want to work."
Wage drift,"The difference between basic pay and total earnings. Wage drift consists of things such as overtime payments, bonuses, PROFIT share and performance-related pay. It usually increases during periods of strong GROWTH and declines during an economic downturn."
Wages,"The PRICE of LABOUR. In theory, wages ought to change so that the SUPPLY and DEMAND in the labour market are always in EQUILIBRIUM. In practice, wages are often sticky, especially in a downward direction: when demand for labour falls, wages do not fall. In this situation, the fall in demand results in higher involuntary UNEMPLOYMENT. Trade UNIONS may use collective bargaining to keep wages above the market-clearing rate. Furthermore, many governments impose a MINIMUM WAGE that employers must pay."
Wealth effect,"As people get wealthier, they consume more. This wealth effect has important consequences for MONETARY POLICY. When there is an INTEREST RATE increase, future INCOME from ASSETS such as EQUITIES must be discounted at a higher rate than before. As a result their owners feel poorer and spend less. A cut in interest rates has the opposite effect. Economists disagree on the wealth ELASTICITY of CONSUMPTION: how much consumer spending would rise if wealth increased by, say, 1%. Different consumers may have different wealth elasticity. If most of the increase in wealth goes to poorer people this may have a different wealth effect than if most of it went to people who are already wealthy. The source of the wealth increase may also matter. If SHARE         PRICES rise or interest rates fall, consumers may be slow to spend out of their increased wealth if they think the increase may be temporary. However, if they think a sharp rise in share prices is permanent and the stockmarket then tumbles, the result may be that consumption falls by enough to cause a RECESSION. The wealth effect of rising HOUSE PRICES is particularly uncertain."
Wealth tax,"In most countries, the majority of wealth is concentrated in a fairly small number of hands. This makes a wealth tax appealing to politicians, as it should allow substantial amounts of revenue to be raised from comparatively few people, allowing the TAX BURDEN on the majority of the POPULATION to be kept down. It also appeals because it promotes meritocracy by making it harder to be born with a silver spoon in your mouth. A wealth tax reduces the disparities in wealth rather than INCOME that are the biggest determinant of how the scales are weighted for succeeding generations. What could be better than a tax that produces lots of money for the GOVERNMENT and strikes most voters as being extremely fair?"
Weightless economy,"At the start of the 21st century, the total OUTPUT of the American economy weighed roughly the same as it did 100 years earlier. Yet the value of that output, in REAL TERMS, was 20 times greater. Output is increasingly weightless, produced from INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL rather than physical materials. Production has shifted from steel, heavy copper wire and vacuum tubes to microprocessors, fine fibre-optic cables and transistors. SERVICES have increased their share of GDP. This weightless or dematerialised economy, most economists agree, is not just lighter but also more efficient."
Welfare economics,Economics with a heart. The study of how different forms of economic activity and different methods of allocating scarce resources affect the well being of different individuals or countries. WELFARE economics focuses on questions about EQUITY as well as EFFICIENCY.
Welfare to work,"Active LABOUR market policies, in which GOVERNMENT handouts to the unemployed come with strings attached, designed to get the recipient off welfare and back to work as quickly as possible."
Windfall gains,"INCOME you do not expect, such as winning a lottery prize. Economists have long argued about whether people are likely to save such windfalls or spend them. According to the PERMANENT INCOME HYPOTHESIS, favoured by most economists, people save the lion's share of windfall gains. But real life often contradicts this; ask any lottery winner."
Windfall profit,"A controversial concept, often used by politicians to justify imposing a TAX on PROFIT that in theory is earned unexpectedly, through circumstances beyond the control of the company concerned, and is thus deemed undeserved and ripe for the taking by the tax authorities. As the profits were neither expected nor a result of the efforts of the firm, taxing them should not harm the firm's incentives to maximise future profits. The problem comes when greedy politicians start claiming that profits are windfalls when in fact they are deserved and expected. Then taxing them sends a signal to FIRMS that they should not try too hard to make profits, as if they do too well they will not get to keep the profits anyway. If this became widely believed, effort would probably decline and economic GROWTH would be slower."
Winner-takes-all markets,"No time for losers. In certain jobs, the market pays  individuals not according to their absolute performance but according to their performance relative to others. The INCOME of window cleaners depends upon how many windows they clean, but investment bankers' pay may depend upon their performance ranking. Slightly more talented window cleaners will make only a small difference to the transparency of their customers' windows, but in the markets for selling BONDS that slight edge can mean everything. Rewards at the top are therefore disproportionately high, and rewards below the top are disproportionately low. People in these professions are often willing to work for very little just to have the chance to compete for the top job and the jackpot that comes with it."
Withholding tax,"A tax that is collected at source, before the taxpayer has seen the INCOME or CAPITAL to which the tax applies. In other words, that part of the income or capital due in tax is withheld from the taxpayer, who therefore cannot easily avoid paying the tax. Withholding taxes are frequently imposed on INTEREST and DIVIDENDS."
World Trade Organisation,"Bête noire of anti-globalisation protesters. The World Trade Organisation is the governing body of international trade, setting and enforcing the rules of trade and punishing offenders. Established during the Uruguay Round of talks under the GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE (GATT), it opened for business in 1995 with a membership of 132 countries (rising to 146 by 2003). Countries used to break GATT rules with impunity. They seem to be finding it harder to do so under the WTO. Even so, protestors complain that it does not promote fair trade but does promote the interest of rich countries over poorer one. Supporters of free trade, including The Economist, reckon that all countries are better off as part of a well-regulated international trading system, and that the WTO is the most likely source of the good regulation that is needed."
X-efficiency,"Producing OUTPUT at the minimum possible cost. This is not enough to ensure the best sort of economic EFFICIENCY, which maximises society's total CONSUMER plus PRODUCER SURPLUS, because the quantity of output produced may not be ideal. For instance, a MONOPOLY can be an X-efficient producer, but in order to maximise its PROFIT it may produce a different quantity of output than there would be in a surplus-maximising market with PERFECT COMPETITION."
Yield curve,"Shorthand for comparisons of the INTEREST RATE on GOVERNMENT _x0001__x0001__x0001__x0001__x0001__x0001__x0001__x0001_BONDS of different maturity. If investors think it is riskier to buy a bond with 15 years until it matures than a bond with five years of life, they will demand a higher interest rate (YIELD) on the longer-dated bond. If so, the yield curve will slope upwards from left (the shorter maturities) to right. It is normal for the yield curve to be positive (upward sloping, left to right) simply because investors normally demand compensation for the added RISK of holding longer-term SECURITIES. Historically, a downward-sloping (or inverted) yield curve has been an indicator of RECESSION on the horizon, or, at least, that investors expect the CENTRAL BANK to cut short-term interest rates in the near future. A flat yield curve means that investors are indifferent to maturity risk, but this is unusual. When the yield curve as a whole moves higher, it means that investors are more worried that INFLATION will rise for the foreseeable future and therefore that higher interest rates will be needed. When the whole curve moves lower, it means that investors have a rosier inflationary outlook."
Yield gap,"A way of comparing the performance of BONDS and SHARES. The gap is defined as the AVERAGE         YIELD on equities minus the average yield on  bonds. Because shares are usually riskier investments than bonds, you might expect them to have a higher yield. In practice, the yield gap is often negative, with bonds yielding more than equities. This is not because investors regard equities as safer than bonds (see EQUITY RISK PREMIUM). Rather, it is that they expect most of the benefit from buying shares to come from an increase in their PRICE (CAPITAL appreciation) rather than from DIVIDEND payments. Bond investors usually expect more of their gains to come from coupon payments. They also worry that INFLATION will erode the REAL VALUE of future coupons, making them value current payments more highly than those due in years to come. Moreover, the usefulness of the dividend yield as a guide to the performance of shares has declined since the early 1990s, as increasingly companies have chosen to return cash to shareholders by buying back their own shares rather than paying out bigger dividends."
Zero-sum game,"When the gains made by winners in an economic transaction equal the losses suffered by the losers. It is identified as a special case in GAME THEORY. Most economic transactions are in some sense positive-sum games. But in popular discussion of economic issues, there are often examples of a mistaken zero-sum mentality, such as “PROFIT comes at the expense of WAGES”, “higher PRODUCTIVITY means fewer jobs”, and “IMPORTS mean fewer jobs here”."
Adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM),A mortgage that permits the lender to periodically adjust the interest rate on the basis of changes in a specified index.
Adjusted gross income,Gross income minus specific adjustments.
Allocation,"Ways in which to distribute goods, services or resources."
Alt-A (Alternative A) mortgage,"A non-standard mortgage owed by a borrower characterized by a strong credit history but with fewer traditional features—for example, reduced documentation, low down payment, or non-owner occupier."
Alternatives,The different possibilities to choose from in a given situation.
Annual percentage rate (APR),The percentage cost of credit on an annual basis and the total cost of credit to the consumer. APR combines the interest paid over the life of the loan and all fees that are paid up front.
Appropriation act,A law allowing federal programs or agencies to borrow money and make payments from the Treasury. Congress considers regular appropriation acts annually. These acts fund federal government operations for the coming fiscal year.
Appropriations,Legal authority provided by Congress to federal agencies to spend funds from the U.S. Treasury.
Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF),"A Federal Reserve lending facility that provides funding to U.S. depository institutions and bank holding companies to finance their purchases of high-quality asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) from money market mutual funds under certain conditions. The AMLF was closed on February 1, 2010."
Asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP),"Short-term debt that is typically limited to a fixed maturity of between 1 and 270 days. The proceeds of ABCP issuance are used primarily to purchase various assets, such as trade receivables, consumer debt receivables, auto and equipment loan leases, and collateralized debt obligations. (See also: Commercial paper.)"
Asset-backed security (ABS),"In general, a money or capital market instrument, usually marketable (that is, transferable to third-parties in market transactions), that has specific financial assets generating the cash flow from which the instrument will be paid. (See also: Commercial mortgage-backed security and Residential mortgage-backed security.)"
Auction,A sale of property to the highest bidder.
Automated teller machine (ATM) card,A form of debit card used in a cash machine to access an account by using a code or personal identification number.
Automatic stabilizers,"A standing policy that activates automatically without intervention, usually during a recession."
Automatic transfer,An online payment that is automatically deducted from the account balance on a recurring basis.
Automation,"Automatically controlled operation of an apparatus, process, or system by mechanical or electronic devices that take the place of human labor."
Bank account register,A tool in which an account holder lists his or her initial balance in an account and then records all debits and credits in order to maintain an accurate record of account activity and an accurate balance.
Bank failure,Occurs when banks are unable to meet depositors' demands for their money.
Bank holding company,"A company that owns, or has controlling interest in, one or more banks. The Federal Reserve is responsible for regulating and supervising bank holding companies, even if the bank owned by the holding company is under the primary supervision of a different federal agency."
Bank panic,"Occurs when a bank run begins at one bank and spreads to others, causing people to lose confidence in banks."
Bank run,Occurs when many depositors rush to the bank to withdraw their money at the same time.
Bankruptcy trustee,"An independent person appointed to administer a bankruptcy case, collect assets, and pay creditors."
Banks,Businesses that accept deposits and make loans.
Bank statement,A statement given to account holders by a bank or credit union to keep them informed of all transactions they made during the statement period. These statements are sent on a regular basis or posted online.
Benefits,Things favorable to a decision maker; rewards gained from an action/activity.
Boom,"A period characterized by sustained increases in several economic indicators—for example, output, investment, and employment."
Borrowing,Taking money with a promise to repay the money in the future.
Boycott,A method of protest where people show a business that they are angry by refusing to buy the goods or services it produces.
Budget deficit,Government expenditures exceed revenues.
Budget functions,"A spending classifications system used for federal budgeting that identifies a specific national need (e.g., national defense or health); includes sub functions."
Budget surplus,"Government collections (taxes and fees) exceed government spending (expenditures) for a given period, usually a fiscal year."
Capital (financial),The funds invested in a bank that are available to absorb loan losses or other problems and therefore protect depositors. Capital includes all equity and some types of debt. Bank regulators have developed two definitions of capital for supervisory purposes: Tier 1 capital can absorb losses while a bank continues operating. Tier 2 capital may be of limited life and may carry an interest obligation or other characteristics of a debt obligation; therefore it provides less protection to depositors than tier 1 capital.
Capital investment,"The purchase of physical capital goods (e.g., buildings, tools and equipment) that are used to produce goods and services."
