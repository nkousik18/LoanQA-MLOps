trained to read long government or policy documents and deliver structured, readable summaries.

### Objective
Read the document context carefully and summarize it in 4–7 clear, information-dense bullet points.
Focus on clarity, key facts, and user relevance.

### Guidance
- Capture the main ideas, not just text snippets.
- Extract all main headings and their sub-points.
- Avoid adding analytical or advisory text.
- Maintain factual order as in the document.
- Use short, crisp sentences (1–2 lines per point).
- Highlight critical details like repayment terms, eligibility, interest rules, or exceptions.
- Maintain a professional tone, similar to official education or banking sources.
- End with one sentence giving overall context or user recommendation if relevant.

### Example Output:
**Summary of Federal Loan Repayment Plans**
- Repayment begins once the borrower leaves school or drops below half-time enrollment.  
- Standard, Graduated, and Income-Driven Plans available.  
- Borrowers can apply for deferment or forbearance during hardship.  
- PLUS Loans available to parents for full cost of attendance.  
- Interest rates are fixed and set annually by the U.S. Department of Education.

This project focuses on digitizing unstructured documents (PDFs or scanned uploads) and
empowering users through translation, voice assistance, and an interactive chatbot. Users can
upload documents, have them digitized and structured, and interactively learn about any word
or sentence by clicking on it—triggering a right-side panel with explanations, translations, or
voice playback. The solution will be delivered as a web dashboard for maximum accessibility
and feature richness. A Chrome extension is considered for future scope.
We will use open-source OCR, translation, and language understanding datasets to train and
evaluate the system's ability to extract, translate, and explain document content. These
datasets are essential for robust digitization and user education features.

1. Introduction
2. Dataset Information
a) Dataset Introduction
b) Data Card
c) Data Sources
OCR:BhasaAnuvaad, IIIT-ILOCR
Translation:BhasaAnuvaad, CVSS
Language Understanding:SQuAD, IndicNLP
d) Data Rights and Privacy
All datasets are open-source and used for research/non-commercial purposes, with no PII
included.
User-uploaded documents will be processed securely, with encryption and access controls.


=== PAGE 2 ===
The system will comply with GDPR and similar regulations by anonymizing data, obtaining
user consent, and allowing data deletion on request.
3. Data Planning and Splits
Loading: Scripts to ingest PDFs/images, convert to text using OCR.
Preprocessing: Clean extracted text, segment sentences, detect language, and align with
translations.
Managing Data: Use version control (e.g., DVC), store metadata (language, domain,
source).
Splitting: 80% training, 10% validation, 10% test, stratified by language and document
type.
4. GitHub Repository
Link: (To be created, e.g., github.com/your-org/doc-digitizer)
Folder Structure:
/data/ — Data scripts and sample datasets
/ocr/ — OCR and preprocessing code
/translation/ — Translation and explanation modules
/voice/ — Voice synthesis and playback
/dashboard/ — Web dashboard code
/docs/ — Documentation and diagrams
/tests/ — Unit/integration tests
README.md — Overview, install, usage, contribution
5. Project Scope
a) Problems
Unstructured documents are hard to search, analyze, or understand.
Language barriers and complex terms hinder user comprehension.
Lack of interactive, accessible tools for document education.
b) Current Solutions
Basic OCR tools extra","The introduction document provides a comprehensive guidebook for setting up and executing user needs + graceful failure, errors+graceful recovery exerty sessions within cross-functional teams. It includes detailed instructions on conducting an error audit to define existing and potential errors along with their solutions by using the provided template that categorizes errors based on rationale, solution type, feedback mechanisms, user control options, etc. Additionally, it emphasizes prioritizing quality assurance methods for monitoring these errors through various channels like customer service reports, social media, in-product metrics, surveys, and research to ensure early detection and continuous improvement of the AI model based on real user experiences. The document also stresses scheduling regular reviews with defined frequencies using a QA template that includes goals, review frequency, methods, start dates, and end dates for each session."
